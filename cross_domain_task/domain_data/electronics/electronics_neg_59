This drive is embedded with Western Digital 's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer . ||| 0
This Virtual CD can not be disabled , unmounted , removed , eradicated , or partitioned away - EVERY ! ! ! ! ||| 0

It says so right on WD 's website buried in the tech support area , not on the box where this kind of `` don't-buy-our-product '' warning belongs . ||| 0
Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you can not , under any circumstances , disable or remove the VCD . ||| 0
It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac ( Windows is no better apparently ) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it . ||| 0
Can you tell that I am upset ? ! ||| 0
? ||| 0
I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one . ||| 0
Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results . ||| 0
Like many people , I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage . ||| 0
If I were to buy more of these like I had planned , My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs . ||| 0
This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your `` My Computer '' window ; but , on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable . ||| 0
I can not believe that Western Digital could not see the alienation of every Mac user on the planet from ten miles away on this one . ||| 0
Western Digital and other drive makers have , for a while now , put their software install packages onto the external hard drives that they sell ; but , it has always been just stored on the drive where it can be deleted or is removed when the drive is reformatted - at worst it was on a separate partition that could be removed . ||| 0
But , not with this new version ( version 3 ? ) ||| 0
of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive 's hardware and can not be deactivated . ||| 0
Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice , their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted . ||| 0
( For more information , see all of the review on the 1TB version of this drive . ) ||| 0
UPDATE : After returning the Essentials drive , I purchased two of Western Digital 's Elements External 1TB Hard Drives ; Exactly what I needed in the first place ... ||| 0
an external hard drive that is built like a tank and is only what it is supposed to be : a hard drive . ||| 0
No `` fancy '' value-added software embedded in the hardware to muck up the works on this drive . ||| 0
I highly recommend the Western Digital Elements external hard drives for all of your storage needs ! ||| 0
