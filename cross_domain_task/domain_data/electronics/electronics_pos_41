The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge . ||| 1
There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos . ||| 1
Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie . ||| 1
The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors . ||| 1
The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4 '' but not widescreen . ||| 1
The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer . ||| 1
The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode ! ||| 1
My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy . ||| 1
But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who 's looking to buy a new computer ! ||| 1
