Pros : picture is great , quick setup , lots of inputs Cons : directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price . ||| 1
Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag . ||| 1
HD tv channels look great , kinda upset that I did n't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable . ||| 1
Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price . ||| 1
This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma . ||| 1
Really enjoy that each input has its own settings ( example : input 1 ( xbox ) I have DCM turned off . ||| 1
Input 2 ( tv ) dcm is turned on to maximize the HD channels ) Sound is not rated because I use a surround system to TV speakers have been on 0 volume since it came out of the box . ||| 1
