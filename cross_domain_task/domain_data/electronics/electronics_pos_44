Pros : You already know the great features . ||| 1
12X zoom , 8MP , etc.. no need to repeat . ||| 1
... Cons : EVF a little slow , but okay after getting used to it . ||| 1
The Bottom Line : Buy this camera , and if you have n't taken a decent picture before , this will make you look like a pro ! ||| 1
After researching and comparing this camera ( fz30 ) with others in this price range and higher , I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30 . ||| 1
After two weeks of picture takin ' and putting the camera through some of it 's many features , ( it has features galore ! ||| 1
) . ||| 1
I must say this camera is AWESOME . ||| 1
Truly fantastic pictures . ||| 1
Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO . ||| 1
But like all electronic equipment , ( LCD , HDTV , TV monitors , and digcams ) , you have to adjust the controls ( PICT.ADJ ) to get the best picture , or a picture set to your personal preference ; you know-contrast , brightness , sharpness , etc ... well , the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly , practically eliminates the so called 'noise ' problem . ||| 1
Remember 'noise ' is part of digital technology and all digital cameras have 'noise'- yes DSLR do too , it 's inherent in the technology ( pixels ) . ||| 1
Just like all film cameras will show grain , noticeable under low lighting conditions with film . ||| 1
So , reducing grain in the best of cameras has to do with the film , lighting and the photographer . ||| 1
It 's the same with reducing 'noise ' in digital cameras . ||| 1
If you are getting 'noise ' simply set the Pict.Adj to [ high noise reduction ] , use a flash , tripod , or play with some of the controls and learn how to use the camera and lighting to eliminate noise . ||| 1
If the picture on a TV is grainy you adjust the sharpness , contrast etc . ||| 1
the FZ30 is of the same technology ( digital/electronic ) and has similar menu 's . ||| 1
And just as a pro photographer takes great pains by using high power lights and accessories like flash , tripods etc . ||| 1
in low lighting situations even with his high priced camera , high priced lens and thousands of dollars worth of equipment to get a fantastic shot ( He does n't blame the camera , just as an artist does n't blame his brushes for how his pictures turn out ) ! ||| 1
? ||| 1
Well , simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $ 500.00 camera as with a $ 5000 . ||| 1
camera . ||| 1
Yes , for the money and features this is the best of the bunch . ||| 1
It does all you ask of it and more . ||| 1
So if 'noise ' is your only complaint , learn how to use the camera controls , and remember it wo n't perform like a $ 10,000 camera with stage lighting , camera crew and a professional photographer , even if you think it should . ||| 1
But it does comes close if you know what you 're doing ! ||| 1
