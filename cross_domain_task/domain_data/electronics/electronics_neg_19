I had originally purchased the Motorola S9 HD headset from the apple store , but took it back because I thought there might be something better . ||| 0
So I bought the Sony Bluetooth Headset like the one above . ||| 0
Anyway , as soon as I strapped these things on , I realized that I made a big mistake . ||| 0
The Sony BT Headset has great sound quality , but who designed the size of this thing ? ||| 0
It 's awful ! ||| 0
The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable , and if you are wearing a collar of any sort , when you move your head at all , it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears . ||| 0
If you want a headset for the gym like I do , then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek . ||| 0
The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck . ||| 0
Terrible design . ||| 0
