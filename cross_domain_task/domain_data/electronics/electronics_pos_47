I run the A/V department in a large hospital . ||| 1
We have 8 of these units and with the exception of one of them just quit working . ||| 1
The others have been going strong and they do n't use much battery power . ||| 1
Also , the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away . ||| 1
Problems Encountered : Had one bad one that I had replaced . ||| 1
One unit is over three years old . ||| 1
