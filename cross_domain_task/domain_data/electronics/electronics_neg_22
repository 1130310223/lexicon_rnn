I bought this card for hot swap RAID 1 , which is one of the features that is supported . ||| 0
A few months after using it , it stopped RAIDing across automatically . ||| 0
When I called them to solve this problem , it was horrible . ||| 0
They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which did n't work . ||| 0
When I called their support 5 , yes , 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware , they told me first that the iso was fine , then to use a boot diskette , then to use the iso . ||| 0
Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550 . ||| 0
Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it did n't solve the issue , I was sent to `` level 3 '' support . ||| 0
The person there knew the ins and outs of this card . ||| 0
He told me it had a bug and they did n't have a upgrade to fix it because they still did n't know what caused it . ||| 0
I could try some perl scripting . ||| 0
I do n't mind dealing with pearl scripts , but it was n't supported and he would n't tell me anything about what the script did , so it was n't that helpful . ||| 0
Later trying to decide what to do about this problem , I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back . ||| 0
I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else , the people I was sent to would n't admit that it had a bug in the card , but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX ( SXU 4LP ) . ||| 0
Is this the way 3ware builds their business ? ||| 0
I could have purchased a sub $ 100 card and received better results . ||| 0
I wo n't be purchasing from 3ware again . ||| 0
