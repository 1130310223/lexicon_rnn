Pros : Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this . ||| 1
Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren , black blacks , HD . ||| 1
Cons : The only downer would be lack of bluray , but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers , far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this that 's saying something . ||| 1
Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7 , and it 's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook , but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match . ||| 1
Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs. , and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch , $ 1700 , , and Macbook pro $ 1499 , in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram , and virtual processors , a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users , but one necessary for future proofing , and currently , for high end , graphic intensive software . ||| 1
I 'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned , and the fact that its running windows this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book . ||| 1
Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512 , a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200 , both have led screens , but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 though it does n't seem to matter . ||| 1
Both have great displays . ||| 1
Still it is running windows , not that 7 isn'ta great improvement . ||| 1

This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy , and that it can handle even the toughest jobs . ||| 1
Its screen , a 720p led , actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually . ||| 1
Its colors are natural , not so over bright , yet its not faint or washed out . ||| 1
The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop , along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside , besides not having a Bluray . ||| 1
However , by turning up the brightness , I was able to compensate . ||| 1
That usually makes my eyes tired , but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems . ||| 1
Lastly its case is fingerprint free , its speakers are movie experience loud , hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ... ||| 1
