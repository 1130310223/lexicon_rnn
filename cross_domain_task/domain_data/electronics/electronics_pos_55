Got these speakers for X-mas . ||| 1
They sounded a little flat at first ; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs ( compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC ) . ||| 1
There 's no treble control on the unit . ||| 1
I also own JBL Creatures which look and sound awesome plus have bass and treble control knobs on the sub . ||| 1
Of course the sound of either system can be adjusted via the equalizer in your Real or Windows Media Players . ||| 1
Back to the I-trigues ; the more I listened to them , the better they started to sound . ||| 1
As I read in another post , there seems to be a break-in period . ||| 1
The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound , more detailed ; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers . ||| 1
I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks . ||| 1
Again a treble control would have been nice though . ||| 1
Overall , very impressive speakers . ||| 1
They also look great next to my 20 '' monitor w/ their tall slender appearance . ||| 1
