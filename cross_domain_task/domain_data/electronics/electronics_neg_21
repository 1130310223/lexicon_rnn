I have owned it since Nov 2009 . ||| 0
The HD2 is the best phone . ||| 0
The Apps issue is not so bad . ||| 0
Just go to XDA-developers.com . ||| 0
Besides it runs many google apps , and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless . ||| 0
You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge . ||| 0
Soon we will get the HTC HD3 . ||| 0
I will be a buyer in the fall . ||| 0
Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen . ||| 0
Do n't forget the Apple choice is a closed system , no real choices beyond Apples product line . ||| 0
No so with HTC ( hd2 , Hd3 ) ||| 0
