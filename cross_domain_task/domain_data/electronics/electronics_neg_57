Pros : this is a very attractive sportband . ||| 0
It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand . ||| 0
It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it wo n't get into the way while exercising . ||| 0
Cons : the iPhone 3GS simply wo n't fit into the pouch . ||| 0
It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly . ||| 0
For instance , there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up . ||| 0
But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it wo n't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned . ||| 0
Also , around hole where the iPhone goes in , there 's a thin strip of what appears to be paper that 's glued around the mouth is located . ||| 0
The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone . ||| 0
Very poor quality and design . ||| 0
No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day . ||| 0
Highly not recommend it . ||| 0
