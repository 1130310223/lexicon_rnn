Pros : Durable , Quiet ... Cons : Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer . ||| 1
Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go . ||| 1
It 's cool looking , super quiet , and a very small form factor . ||| 1
The software they provide is pretty ... ||| 1
but clunky and slow as hell . ||| 1
I am using it as a network drive and via a standard 100mbs network . ||| 1
Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete ... ||| 1
not that its done it should be very quick , but 2 days ? ? ||| 1
? ||| 1
I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background . ||| 1
Love the drive ... ||| 1
will continue to search for other backup software ||| 1
