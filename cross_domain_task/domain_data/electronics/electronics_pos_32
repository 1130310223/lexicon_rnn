I bought this product to use mainly as a way to carry movies around on vacation for my children . ||| 1
It works great for that and much more . ||| 1
I do n't know if the kids are going to get to use it . ||| 1
I am very impressed with the quality of the playback . ||| 1
It could be a little more user friendly , but I managed to figure it out easily enough . ||| 1
Also , you get more than enough playing time on the battery . ||| 1
I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery . ||| 1
It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well . ||| 1
