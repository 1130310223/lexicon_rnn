This is best done on a tripod to eliminate shake and to keep the object centered . ||| 1
Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality . ||| 1
The camera is light but feels solid . ||| 1
Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed . ||| 1
The vibration reduction can not be faulted even at maximum zoom . ||| 1
