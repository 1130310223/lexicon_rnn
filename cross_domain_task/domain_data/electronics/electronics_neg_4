Having just switched from ADSL to NTL cable broadband I needed a new router to replace the Speedtouch Wireless router that came free with my ADSL connection . ||| 0
The reviews for this were good , as was the price so I took the plunge . ||| 0
Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support ( which were quick at responding ) and I finally got it working . ||| 0
The problem is this router does n't really support Apple Macs . ||| 0
My previous router/modems ( Speedtouch and Netgear wired ) were literally plug and play . ||| 0
I managed to network two Mac desktops , an iBook , a Windows laptop , an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems , except setting up the Windows wireless , but even that connected to the Macs on the network . ||| 0
I 've set up even larger Mac only networks so I know what I 'm doing . ||| 0
This Linksys just did n't want to play . ||| 0
I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router , then get it on the 'Net , using wires and wireless . ||| 0
I have n't even attempted to get the other machines online yet . ||| 0
If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses . ||| 0
Hopefully now it is running I wo n't need to do that again , and getting the other machines connected will be easier . ||| 0
