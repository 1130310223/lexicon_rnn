I bought this headset to use in the car . ||| 0
It 's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket , the headset is in the charger , no tangling wires - great ! ||| 0
But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them , and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size ! ||| 0
: ) It does n't fit into my son 's and friend 's ears as well - keeps falling out . ||| 0
And the sound quality - my God ! ||| 0
People I 've been talking to were always complaining about low volume ( they had it maxed on their receivers ) and strange rustling and swishing noise . ||| 0
I 've heard them better , but far away from good . ||| 0
If I could , I would like to return it or exchange for something better . ||| 0
