This is a nice stereo , but the product specs are off . ||| 1
When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player . ||| 1
It really does n't . ||| 1
It does however play five cds , has an aux input and is XM ready . ||| 1
I 'm not that far advanced for XM . ||| 1
I 'm in the cassette tape stone ages . ||| 1
If anyone is looking for the ultimate cassette tape player , I would suggest the JVC Kaboom Box . ||| 1
It has great sound and auto reverse . ||| 1
Anyway , back to the Sony . ||| 1
This is perfect for my computer . ||| 1
I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor . ||| 1
It plays 5 cd 's with modes like shuffle , repeat and random . ||| 1
So , if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too . ||| 1
