I purchased this camera a month ago or more after almost buying the G11 , and have taken about a thousand photos with it so far . ||| 1
I could n't be happier with the wide lens , aperture control ring , manual functions , scene pre-settings , overall low light performance , and ease of customization this little camera offers . ||| 1
Even love the minimal black design of it . ||| 1
I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ( $ 400 ) and the Canon name ( still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively ) , and as far as image quality I ca n't really find any faults . ||| 1
Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much ; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning . ||| 1
The included software is necessary however to convert the raw CR2 files into Tiff files for Photoshop . ||| 1
Bundled with the included software is a PhotoStitch program that allows you to 'stitch ' individual shots together to make panormas . ||| 1
Very cool . ||| 1
I 'm using it almost daily and have n't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is . ||| 1
There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame : ca n't begin to say how useful that is . ||| 1
It even brackets . ||| 1
The real disappointment here is the build quality . ||| 1
I 've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy . ||| 1
An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this -- overall more dense and metallic . ||| 1
The camera body seems decent enough , but the plastic dials , especially the menu control , are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it . ||| 1
While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy , this is a $ 400 camera . ||| 1
It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice ( I keep it off ) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I 'm sure its just a flimsy , plastic rack and pinion mechanism . ||| 1
The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot ... the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below , or shooting one-handed . ||| 1
Again not using the flash makes this a non-issue for me , I 'd be just as happy if Canon left the flash off entirely or at least integrated it into the body to simplify the design . ||| 1
Other reviewers have criticized the battery life ... this has n't been much of an issue for me . ||| 1
I keep the camera off between shots , have the LCD turned down a bit , rarely use the movie mode and flash , so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge . ||| 1
A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery , but I can live with that . ||| 1
If you were taking this camera on an extended trip to some remote locale a spare battery would be a necessity . ||| 1
As I keep it off when I 'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot : maybe 3-4 secs or so . ||| 1
When you 're in a hurry to catch something that can feel like a long delay . ||| 1
Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted ( RAW shooting , wide lens , full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments ) and then some in my back pocket . ||| 1
There 's certainly better cameras out there ( the G11 is only marginally more expensive ) , but none I 'd want to haul around on a daily basis . ||| 1
Hopefully somebody at Canon is checking these product reviews and the next generation S90 will feel like the smooth , solidly-built slab of metal the older PowerShots were . ||| 1
