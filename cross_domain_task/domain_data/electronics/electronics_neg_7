I bought this unit hoping to archive my old personal VHS tapes . ||| 0
I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer 's DVD player which I 'm sure is a cheaper player by far . ||| 0
After repeatedly trying to get the unit to accept my pre-recorded DVD 's it finally accepted them . ||| 0
I noticed that the unit could n't recognize the markers from my computer 's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly . ||| 0
It works , but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which , again , my computer 's DVD player does seamlessly . ||| 0
I expected the unit to far surpass my computer 's DVD player and it does n't . ||| 0
I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement . ||| 0
