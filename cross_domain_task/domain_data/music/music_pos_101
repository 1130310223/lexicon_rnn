This record blows my mind . ||| 1
It is at once catchy , hummable and avant-garde . ||| 1
There are two big `` wow '' points here . ||| 1
The first is the `` string , '' ( le fil ) , a tone that persists throughout the entire record ( and beyond , into secret-track land ) . ||| 1
This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite : not that the songs do n't stand by themselves , but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one . ||| 1
The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella . ||| 1
Yes , there are instruments . ||| 1
But no , the instruments do n't take center stage . ||| 1
It 's all about the voice , the human beatbox , and the clap . ||| 1
This gives the record a real organic feeling : it does n't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory . ||| 1
I am amazed at Camille 's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it . ||| 1
The lyrics are wry , funny , and thought-provoking , but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production . ||| 1
I am sure many people will browse this CD on Amazon and imagine that it 's some kind of folk-song/chanson update , along the lines of Keren Ann , Carla Bruni , or Coralie Clement . ||| 1
It 's not ; it 's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies ' music . ||| 1
Incomparable is really the best word to describe `` Le Fil . '' ||| 1
