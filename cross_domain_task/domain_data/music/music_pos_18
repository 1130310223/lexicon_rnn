If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs , then this one is a no-brainer . ||| 1
You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release , but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc . ||| 1
I have not compared the standard Red Book release to this one . ||| 1
What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past . ||| 1
Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation . ||| 1
No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording . ||| 1
It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono 's non-dimensionality . ||| 1
The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback . ||| 1
Moon 's cymbals are transparent ... his drumwork really stands out on this release . ||| 1
In fact , all the instruments are much better defined . ||| 1
Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job ... he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who . ||| 1
YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE ! ||| 1
