My music find of the year - mesmerizing ! ||| 1
First and foremost , this is psychedelic rock built on a strong pop framework . ||| 1
A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London , circa 1968 . ||| 1
From then on , it becomes a game of `` spot-the-reference '' . ||| 1
The early Who , Pretty Things , Love , Moody Blues , the Beatles , 13th Floor Elevators , and any number of the 60s British one-hit wonders would probably come to mind . ||| 1
Combine all of them , get Thurston Moore to play ( a real ) melody lead on electric guitar , add a bit of distortion , and you begin to get the idea . ||| 1
Sixties-wise , it has all the right elements : layered guitars , reverb , echo , jangle , phasing and harmonies . ||| 1
And Brian Leary 's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all , pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments . ||| 1
Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia , it does n't feel dated in the least ; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout . ||| 1
There are a few straightforward pop songs ; I would defy anyone to listen to `` Your Kind Turn Me All Around '' without catching it flying sorties around your brain a day later . ||| 1
Other songs , including `` Eyes '' , `` Masses of Tiny Dots '' , `` All of the Lovely Sounds '' and `` Color It '' are closer to garage proto- psych/punk . ||| 1
The albums opus is `` Sea Map '' , which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin , Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree . ||| 1
This is balanced by the delicate beauty of `` Scrapbook of Madness '' and `` Satellite Sun '' . ||| 1
And there 's a hint of Beatles flavour to `` When the Ancients Fly '' . ||| 1
It 's a diverse album , moody , brilliant and completely satisfying . ||| 1
The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find . ||| 1
You 're going to wish you had this when you find it 's no longer available ; so do yourself a favor and get it now . ||| 1
And if you enjoy this , watch for their next incarnation : `` Gangster Hippie '' . ||| 1
I 've heard the first GH album , and it 's equally amazing ... ||| 1
