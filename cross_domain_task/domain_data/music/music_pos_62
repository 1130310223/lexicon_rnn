First of all , let me elaborate on the term `` melodic death metal '' . ||| 1
I do not mean `` Gothenburg '' bands , but more accurately , Death Metal that contains some melody . ||| 1
Now that we 've got that out of the way ... ||| 1
Anata is one of those rare bands that has n't yet written a bad song . ||| 1
While most people are only familiar with their third album , `` Under A Stone With No Inscription '' , I 'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise . ||| 1
`` Released When You Are Dead '' opens the album in a deceptive manner , as it is easily the most brutal song on the album . ||| 1
It is still quality though , with a massive slow riff in the middle . ||| 1
From here the songs become more melodic , with vocalist/guitarist/main man Fredrik Shalin alternating between growled and screamed vocals . ||| 1
The third song , `` Under Azure Skies '' , deserves a paragraph of its own . ||| 1
This , my friends , is one of the best metal songs I 've ever heard , period . ||| 1
Battery . ||| 1
Angel Of Death . ||| 1
Davidian . ||| 1
Heartwork . ||| 1
Blinded By Fear . ||| 1
Under Azure Skies . ||| 1
It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics . ||| 1
Beginning with slow , chugging riffs , it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear , harmonies running rampant . ||| 1
But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody , with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics , then screaming over the soft music . ||| 1
I 'm butchering the description , but it 's really a powerful piece . ||| 1
The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies , screams and pounding drums . ||| 1
Simply godly . ||| 1
I could go on and on about this wonderful album , but I wo n't . ||| 1
Instead , I 'll just leave you to check out some of the music , and then maybe you 'll buy it . ||| 1
Recommended like a rest after a hard day 's work . ||| 1
