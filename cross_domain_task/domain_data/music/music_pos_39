Just when we thought synth-pop was dead and buried , the grizzled top end of Gen X decides it ca n't let go and nominates this Norwegian guy to rescue everything that was good about syth-eighties-dance ( the romantic lyricism and desparing sense of `` death tomorrow '' ) and lose everything that was bad ( the overly-romantic lyricism and androgynous tweek of casios `` on the metro '' ) . ||| 1
Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album , artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings . ||| 1
*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain ( more akin to camoflage , depeche mode , and alphaville than moby , prodigy or ministry ) , but offers up no limp wrists . ||| 1
Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes . ||| 1
A good corrective for Covenant fans who wo n't let go of the casios . ||| 1
Groth 's use of female vocals and KORGs works much , much better . ||| 1
Need to dance and sing too ? ||| 1
