It pains me to give a King 's X album such a low score . ||| 0
I mean , I own the entire catalog , I 've seen the band live at least ten times , and have even had beers with the guys after a show . ||| 0
I remember hearing them for the first time as a kid watching late-night TV when their video for Over My Head made a splash for a while on MTV . ||| 0
I 've been a fan ever since . ||| 0
But , alas , I have to be truthful and honest about this collection , as nothing less will benefit the band or fans . ||| 0
This is a sub-par album for any band , let alone one as stellar as King 's X . ||| 0
As many have already mentioned , it 's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that did n't make it onto their first album , Out of the Silent Planet . ||| 0
They were put in the circular file then , and that 's honestly where they should have stayed . ||| 0
The sound is dated , the structures are boring , the lyrics are juvenile and banal ... need I go on ? ||| 0
It 's cheesy , 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution . ||| 0
Screamer is novel enough , but that 's the problem : it 's merely a novelty song to show off Doug 's screaming ability . ||| 0
Rock Pile has a decent enough verse , but the chorus is sickeningly goofy . ||| 0
Johnny is the epic tune that does n't justify its epic length ... Ty 's long solo is the most pointless , meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he 's ever put together into a single chain . ||| 0
The title track is passable . ||| 0
Honestly , this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors . ||| 0
It is definitely not the place to start if you 're just trying to get into King 's X . ||| 0
If you really want to support this band , buy their latest CD , Ogre Tones , which is an excellent , excellent album . ||| 0
It has a great variety of sound , and should satisfy both their later fans that are used to the `` heavy '' version of King 's X as well as their earlier fans that long to hear the soaring guitar and Beatlesesque harmonies . ||| 0
I 'm a fan of both eras , truly , and I think it 's their best CD since Please Come Home Mr. Bulbous , and possibly since Dogman ( another awesome disc that everyone should own ) . ||| 0
Avoid this one , but do n't avoid King 's X. I 'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs , and if I had to give up all but , say , 100 of them , I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King 's X CDs . ||| 0
This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that has n't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes . ||| 0
They deserve many a listen ... just do n't start with Black Like Sunday . ||| 0
