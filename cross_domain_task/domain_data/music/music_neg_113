Not sure why they would release this album in this shape . ||| 0
Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black , with alot of old tired riffs . ||| 0
Where is the Brad Paisley with the rockin ' guitar sound ? ||| 0
The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control . ||| 0
The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album . ||| 0
I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when , and I must say I knew he would be a star , but this album is sooo lack-luster , very disappointing . ||| 0
