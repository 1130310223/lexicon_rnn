While I am a huge fan of Beyonce , when I bought this record , I listened to it ... and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store . ||| 0
Maybe this was a bit harsh , but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash , maybe it was n't punishment enough . ||| 0
Beyonce Knowles is a very talented woman : She is a good actress ( which we are to see more of this summer ) , she has a great voice if put to good use , she writes catchy radio-ready songs and can produce like no one else . ||| 0
Maybe this is why the last Destiny 's Child album , `` Survivor '' , was such a success , Beyonce fully controlled the writing and producing of each track . ||| 0
On `` Dangerously In Love '' , she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands . ||| 0
The best track on this record is clearly `` Crazy in Love '' , an urban love tale that gets you movin ' and singing along ... but every track after it is a total dissapointment . ||| 0
`` Signs '' , co-written with Aaliyah 's muse Missy Elliot , is a mess of nothing ... driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative . ||| 0
But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be `` Gift From Virgo '' ; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it . ||| 0
The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch , about every 5 words or so we 're hearing a new tune . ||| 0
It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape , and is just as enjoyable . ||| 0
The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is `` Dangerously In Love '' , a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce 's girl group , Destiny 's Child . ||| 0
This , I would n't have a problem with if it were a remake at all , instead of an exact replica . ||| 0
The only songs that are worth bearing at all are `` Crazy In Love '' and `` Yes '' , an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future . ||| 0
But believe me , this is still not a reccomendation . ||| 0
If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best , buy any of the three Destiny 's Child album , and do n't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident . ||| 0
It 's saddening to see talent put to waste , both from Beyonce , her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own . ||| 0
Let 's just hope they lose each other 's numbers . ||| 0
