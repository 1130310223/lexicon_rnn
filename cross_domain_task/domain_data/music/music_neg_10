I have PURCHASED every album since 1993 , so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet . ||| 0
I felt that the record they did with Glenn Ballard was a reasonably listenable waste , but thought they made a strong recovery on the next one , `` Busted Stuff '' ( which was the record they SHOULD have released instead of the Ballard one ) . ||| 0
`` Stand up '' stinks up the joint from the cover art ( what is that goofy concept lady ? ||| 0
) , to the tiny tiny song labels on the back . ||| 0
Oh yeah , and the music is lame , with 3-4 exceptions . ||| 0
I wo n't even address the copy protection issue ... that 's been done to death , and I agree with them all . ||| 0
I encourage you to buy this cd ... .my copy is available . ||| 0
