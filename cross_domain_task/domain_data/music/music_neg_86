Chingy 's followup to 2003 's `` The Jackpot '' falls disasterously lower than his debut . ||| 0
Not many of the songs grabbed my attention , his voice gets real annoying after a while too . ||| 0
Do n't get me wrong , there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them . ||| 0
Hot Tracks : Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Do n't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26 's Do n't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were . ||| 0
Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he 's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more . ||| 0
It 's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album . ||| 0
Do n't even waste your money . ||| 0
