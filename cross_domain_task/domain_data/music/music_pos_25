Pros : catchiness , replayability , fun , energetic ... Cons : simplicity The Bottom Line : Buy It ! ||| 1
My friends love it , my little brother loves it , my parents love it - you will too ! ||| 1
Paramore just recently broke into the scene and have become very well known in a very short amount of time . ||| 1
Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams , the band also features guitarist Josh Farro , drummer Zac Farro , bassist Jeremy Davis , and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb , all under the age of 21 . ||| 1
The album starts with `` All We Know '' , a catchy ( but straightforward , systemaic ) power-pop song . ||| 1
`` Pressure '' has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single , and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer . ||| 1
`` Emergency '' and `` Brighter '' both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs . ||| 1
`` Here We Go Again '' demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses . ||| 1
Farro 's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy , showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile . ||| 1
`` Never Let This Go '' is a welcome change of pace to the album , and the melody kind of reminds me of `` The War '' by Melee , though LOOSELY . ||| 1
The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings `` Please do n't get me wrong , because I 'll never let this go , but I ca n't find the words to tell you I do n't wan na be alone , but now I feel like I do n't know you '' , and then it 's right back to the soft guitars and drums . ||| 1
Definitely one of the better tracks on the album . ||| 1
`` Whoa '' has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album , but it 'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows . ||| 1
`` Consipracy '' and `` Franklin '' also have basic lyrics , with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship , and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything ( mostly peoples ' reactions to you ) being different . ||| 1
The songs are n't going to win any awards from `` lyric-lovers '' , but they are , as the entire album has been , catchy . ||| 1
These few songs show the age of the band the most , but I 'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them . ||| 1
The closer , `` My Heart '' , reminds me a lot of `` Some Will Seek Forgiveness ... ||| 1
Others Escape '' by Underoath , because the song starts slow , seems to be another basic song just like the last two , but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album . ||| 1
'All We Know Is Falling ' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head . ||| 1
This band has such potential to go far : down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans , catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show ( I was very surprised ) . ||| 1
I think , if you give this band a couple years , they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene , and will be selling out large venues soon . ||| 1
