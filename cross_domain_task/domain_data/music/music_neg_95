Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds , but this album is an absolute joke . ||| 0
a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets , it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana ( loud guitars and screaming ) with the down-tuned sound of Korn . ||| 0
Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band , which in many respects they are . ||| 0
Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal ' scene in years . ||| 0
So obviously designed for kids , to allow them to shock mummy and daddy , i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records . ||| 0
It is as manufactured as Britney , Steps 5ive etc , and on the same level musically . ||| 0
The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement , especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music , and not about their identities . ||| 0
Please ! ||| 0
the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction . ||| 0
Just scroll down the reviews and see how many kidies have referred to their `` disturbing '' and `` satanic '' image . ||| 0
The songs are actually really bad as well , with the possible exception of Wait and bleed . ||| 0
As a whole , i would recomend bands such as Tool , AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot . ||| 0
manufactured anger , for a manufactured audience . ||| 0
And no kiddies , this is not being rebellious . ||| 0
