I 've been a Neil Finn fan practically my whole adult life . ||| 0
First I become exposed to his brilliance via I Got You , the break through song of Split Enz a quarter of a century ago . ||| 0
That album , True Colours , is jam packed with great melodies and fun arrangements . ||| 0
Although their later albums did not match that peak , they were still enjoyable . ||| 0
When Crowded House became huge , I liked their albums ever more . ||| 0
Their first one , despite including the classic Do n't Dream It 's Over , is their least interesting one but during the final album , Together Alone , Neil Finn and Crowded House were making among the best music of that era . ||| 0
I was obviously very excited when Neil Finn released ( Try Whistling ) this album ; what would he deliver this time being alone and apparently with all the freedom to experiment ? ||| 0
Before hearing the album in its entirety , I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner , both great tracks and worthy classics . ||| 0
She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm . ||| 0
Sadly , these were the only tracks worth any attention . ||| 0
The production of the album is very flat , everything very professional like but lacking an edge . ||| 0
The songs really never come to life . ||| 0
I tried several times listening to the album , hoping I would get it , but no , this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark , something I ca n't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn ( his next studio album , live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better ) . ||| 0
Actually , this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine . ||| 0
It is interesting but this album gets high marks from many reviewers , actually most reviewers . ||| 0
My sister and one of my best friends are also big Neil Finn fans . ||| 0
Their reaction to this album was , however , almost identical to mine , close to being boring and not living up to expectations . ||| 0
It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it . ||| 0
My advice , however , is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn . ||| 0
