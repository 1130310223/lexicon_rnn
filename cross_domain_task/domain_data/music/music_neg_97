If this CD is `` remastered '' , it certainly was not from the 1st generation , multi-track session tapes . ||| 0
From listening to this CD , I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss , especially through the quiet passages of `` I 've Grown Accustomed To Her Face '' . ||| 0
And after all these years , we STILL get `` Mexican Shuffle '' in MONO ! ||| 0
Which leads me to believe that this , and other TJB CD 's in Herb Alpert 's Signature Series , were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A & M vinyl LP 's back in the 1960s ( a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago , which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD ) . ||| 0
In this day and age of today 's advanced digital technology , a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s , was missed . ||| 0
I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD 's in both STEREO and MONO , just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles ' Capitol albums , would have been nice . ||| 0
Maybe Universal , given time , would have done a much better job at remastering these early A & M classic albums . ||| 0
I say this because , in my opinion , I think the people at Universal are doing an outstanding job at remastering some of the Motown material ( ie `` The Motown Box '' ) . ||| 0
Sorry Herb , but I think you missed the boat with this series . ||| 0
