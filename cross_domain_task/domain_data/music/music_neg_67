Let me preface this review by saying that I do n't hate Paul Oakenfold . ||| 0
I do n't have a personal vendetta to pursue against him , and in fact I absolutely love Bunkka and Tranceport . ||| 0
That said , this album is very poor . ||| 0
Oakenfold is one of the main reasons I began to love trance , electronica , and even dance . ||| 0
When I first heard Tranceport , I was amazed with what I was hearing , and began to dig into a whole new world of music I had never known about before . ||| 0
I owe Mr. Oakenfold a debt for turning me on to music I now love and listen to on a daily basis . ||| 0
Unfortunately , Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection . ||| 0
This is not a trance album . ||| 0
It is a collection of pop-happy fluff , filler , and unremarkable songs that simply do n't appeal to me at all . ||| 0
I realize that opinions vary , and I 'm sure I 'll get lit up for writing a negative review , but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money . ||| 0
Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop . ||| 0
Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly ( Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this ) . ||| 0
Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music , and the beat gets lost in the background . ||| 0
Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original . ||| 0
Also , many of these tracks are just filler or fluff , such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as : `` 9 . ||| 0
James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold , Norman , Monty '' James Bone Theme is about right . ||| 0
I honestly ca n't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself `` You know what would be great ? ||| 0
Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes ! '' ||| 0
If this is a collection of Oakenfold 's 'greatest ' hits , then were are tracks like 'Gamemaster , ' from Tranceport or 'Ready Steady Go , ' from Bunkka ? ||| 0
Where is 'Zoo York , ' and 'Get em up ' also from Bunkka ? ||| 0
This is not a collection of his greatest work . ||| 0
It is a collection of meaningless , passionless remixes or pop dance tunes . ||| 0
If you loved Tranceport , do n't spend your money on this CD . ||| 0
If you loved Bunkka , do n't spend your money either . ||| 0
If you love movie sound tracks , pop remixes , or soft edged dance music , you might enjoy this CD . ||| 0
