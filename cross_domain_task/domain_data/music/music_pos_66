In an earlier review I had stated that TD 's `` Melrose '' was their most haunting since this one . ||| 1
Well `` Hyperborea '' is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book . ||| 1
It really does , as reviewer Morse put it , take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there . ||| 1
I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening ' . ||| 1
And on the title track , 'Hyperborea ' , I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape . ||| 1
If you like a surreal sound , this is the one for you . ||| 1
And yes , as reviewer Morse also stated , you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone ( just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound , it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out ) . ||| 1
You could actually ( and this may appall the most devout new age listeners ! ||| 1
) consider `` Hyperborea '' 'nature music ' , for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind . ||| 1
Does that sound like someone on an acid trip ? ||| 1
Just buy it and you 'll understand . ||| 1
And you should also enjoy it immensely . ||| 1
