Only at the repeated insistence of my friend A. did I sit down and *really* listen to this album . ||| 1
I must admit that I regard much contemporary r & b and hip-hop with skepticism because of the same lack of individuality that is rife in the boy-band repertoire . ||| 1
Anything with high praise on a big label ( eg Columbia ) -- especially anything that gets high praise in `` awards '' shows , must be sub par . ||| 1
Lauryn Hill knows this -- and sings about it ( `` Superstar '' ) -- and produces an album that *she* wanted . ||| 1
The result is anything but ordinary . ||| 1
Her voice is silky and direct , and her lyric smart and direct . ||| 1
This is pure soul -- its naked bearing , its deep hurt , its highest joys . ||| 1
The song , `` To Zion , '' merits owning the album alone . ||| 1
In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about -- its essence ; a mother of music , indeed . ||| 1
Simply amazing . ||| 1
