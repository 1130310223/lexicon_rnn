I really hate to say it , because i think Ani Difranco is awesome , but this album is very bad . ||| 0
At best , it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides . ||| 0
She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album . ||| 0
I tried to like this album , and it 's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album , but she has . ||| 0
This album more or less sucks . ||| 0
None of the songs stand out from each other . ||| 0
They all sound like experiments that were n't seen through from start to finish . ||| 0
Unlike bands like Radiohead , David Bowie , The cure etc . ||| 0
that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory , Ani just gave a half-a $ $ effort and it shows . ||| 0
