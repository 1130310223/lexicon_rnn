I am a big fan of Jose Jose and for many years I have been following his career . ||| 0
This is not only a big disappointment ; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose 's fans . ||| 0
First , this is not a 2007 new release , is an old collection of songs from the 70 's and the 80 's Do n't let them fool you with Jose Jose 's intros for every song , where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice . ||| 0
It 's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business ( money ) . ||| 0
The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source . ||| 0
Do n't buy or rent this DVD ||| 0
