Formed by a former Throbbing Gristler and a buddy , Coil is difficult to describe as anything but `` experimental '' and `` electronic . '' ||| 1
Some of their albums consist of little more than curious drones , while others are swirling with noises the hearer 's mind can not contain . ||| 1
*Loves Secret Domain* , released on the now post-indie WaxTrax label and currently out of print , collects a number of melodic , pop-based `` songs '' ( they actually are coherent , with beginnings and ends ) that are at times profoundly dancey ( `` Snow '' ) , goth-y ( as with the title track ) , meditative and pleasant or just plain WEIRD ( the rest of the album ) . ||| 1
This their most accessible album tends to be their best , in my opinion ( proof enough that these bois are capable of good , unpredictable , thoroughly enjoyable `` pop '' ) . ||| 1
*Stolen and Contaminated Songs* consists , literally , of songs ripped from the WaxTrax album and reworked . ||| 1
This album is not as good nor accessible , but remains an enjoyable , second best . ||| 1
Do n't expect the sonata form ! ||| 1
