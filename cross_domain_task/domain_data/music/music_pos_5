I , like the first reviewer , first heard Robert Berry on the Yes tribute album and I thought he put a neat spin on on the Yes classic Roundabout . ||| 1
I really never thought much more about Robert Berry . ||| 1
That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area , started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts . ||| 1
Wow , Robert Berry , who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70 's . ||| 1
It 's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist . ||| 1
How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards ? ||| 1
Very cool , not that ELP 's version is n't great too . ||| 1
He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member . ||| 1
He also does some interesting covers of rush , Pink Floyd and Jethro tull . ||| 1
I would never say that this is essential prog material , but hey , for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel , I 'll go for this Thanks . ||| 1
