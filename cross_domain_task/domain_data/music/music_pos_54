This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further . ||| 1
The book explores the Words of Jesus in their original Aramaic . ||| 1
The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz ' scholarship into the realm of the auditory . ||| 1
The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words . ||| 1
He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation . ||| 1
These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language . ||| 1
This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life . ||| 1
Interestingly I would have expected that it would be suitable only for a Christian participator . ||| 1
However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition . ||| 1
Having used the CDs and having read the original book , I am also left wondering how `` The Passion of Christ '' a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs . ||| 1
Fully recommended ||| 1
