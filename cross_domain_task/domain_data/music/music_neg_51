Well , I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks , because , I do n't know , it 's pretty salty . ||| 0
First of all , the bass player ... fat pocket , this guy must wear big raver pants , because he has such fat pocket . ||| 0
I am thinking , Kik Wear , Sonic 2000 , the ones that are bright pink . ||| 0
So , anyway , the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic , it is so inside , and it completely matches with the melody . ||| 0
Um , the guitar player , you can tell he has fat pockets too , and fat licks . ||| 0
But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down . ||| 0
I do n't know , I think he still is pretty putrid . ||| 0
And the drummer , he is so good , he keeps it in , out , and in the middle of the pocket , and his pork chops , they are so salty , if you licked it you would have to wince . ||| 0
Oh my gosh , and he always is mixing it up , from hi hat to ride cymbal , dang , it 's so chopped I do n't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring ! ! ||| 0

I think Beef Jerky . ||| 0
Overall , I think this band is pretty chopped , but I do n't think the licks are wet enough . ||| 0
I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside , because it just sounds like he does n't move around at all . ||| 0
Um , and that one guy that wrote the review that says , `` these guys are mega wicked chill '' um , I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani , because your pockets are so tight , and I do n't even think you know what you 're talking about . ||| 0
