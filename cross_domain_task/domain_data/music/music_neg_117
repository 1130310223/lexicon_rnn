Before I start , I 'm just gon na say I 'm not an amazing reviewer , but I am going to give an honest review . ||| 0
I am definately not the biggest Beyonce fan by far , as I usually like to stray away from mainstream music as often as I can , being such over processed crap as most of it is . ||| 0
But this is Beyonce we 're talking about , she has amazing talent , and an amazing vocal range . ||| 0
Which is why I 'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album . ||| 0
It 's almost like she 's saying , `` I 'm Beyonce , I 'm amazing , and people will jump on anything I create , so why even make an attempt . '' ||| 0
I 'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album , and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such , all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album . ||| 0
There was nothing deluxe about it . ||| 0
After listening to the first disc , I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I did n't have the same song on repeat over and over . ||| 0
The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads , that lack just that , power . ||| 0
There was no emotion , they all sounded exactly the same : bland , dull , and over-polished . ||| 0
It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental , back to back , and called it a night . ||| 0
The second disc I 'm assuming was supposed to be the disc with club anthems , party songs and such . ||| 0
It had the typical `` independent '' ladies song , and the typical `` boast like a man '' song . ||| 0
I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot . ||| 0
Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song `` Single Ladies '' , which I 'm still not bananas about . ||| 0
Beyonce , you 're incredible , but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you . ||| 0
Giving it two stars is generous , and I was n't in the mood . ||| 0
It definately seems like I 'm bashing Beyonce in this review , but I 'm not bashing her , I 'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release . ||| 0
I 'm sure she 'll notice the poor feedback from this cd and the next will be incredible . ||| 0
She should definately take her time and create an album with songs that have some staying power . ||| 0
Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it 's definately this one . ||| 0
