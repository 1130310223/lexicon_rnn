This is one amazingbook about a man ( Gary Paulsen ) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska . ||| 1
It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process , and then onto the grueling , tiring , painful race . ||| 1
This book shows how one man connects with nature and his dogs and how these dogs arent being changed by him , but he is being changed by the dogs . ||| 1
He gives a great account of his loving ( and obviously favorite ) dog Cookie , the lead of his team . ||| 1
He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it 's start in Anchorage , Alaska . ||| 1
Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion , and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations . ||| 1
I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone , especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals . ||| 1
Nothing but the best ! ||| 1
