Vicente himself observed that before him there only existed sophisticated guidelines on different aspects of human-machine interaction but no holistic approach that is fit for the engineer . ||| 1
So he undertook the work and succeeded . ||| 1
Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery , putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time ' principle . ||| 1
In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent , logical and refreshing to read . ||| 1
The work is intended for big industrial projects , so our positive experince with a small-scale project is not representative . ||| 1
Still , Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments . ||| 1
The only drawback is the use of the example microworld . ||| 1
I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system . ||| 1
