Mortimer 's `` How to read a book '' is a 400 page saga on rules of reading literature , science , maths , history and poetry . ||| 0
I am sure that when it was first published in 1940s , it was the ground breaking first book ever that taught people how to read . ||| 0
Its analysis on different levels of reading and types of books must have sounded very revealing to readers . ||| 0
However , today , 60 years after it was first published , `` How to read a Book '' does n't impress as much . ||| 0
Since you are interested in this book , I will assume that you read a lot of text and are primarily looking for something that will : 1 ) Increase your Speed 2 ) Increase your comprehension . ||| 0
This is not the book for your goal . ||| 0
The book starts with the Goals of Reading and quickly moves on to different levels of reading ( Elementary , Inspectional , Analytical and Syntopical ) . ||| 0
In a nutshell all that Mortimer wants to communicate is that there are 2 types of reading , one that you do for entertainment and one for aquiring information or understanding . ||| 0
In both cases , it pays to be an active reader ( more in 2nd than in first ) . ||| 0
To become an active reader , you have to follow these simple rules : 1 ) Look for the theme , crux of the book 2 ) Look for outline , structure or organization of the book 3 ) Understand what author is trying to say 4 ) Understand why author is saying that 5 ) What arguments he gives to support himself 6 ) Arguments against what he wants to disprove 7 ) Terms and language he uses That 's it ! ||| 0
This is pretty much the summary of the book . ||| 0
He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across . ||| 0
It took me an hour to go through first 50 pages as I was really trying to give this book enough time . ||| 0
However , once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble , I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps . ||| 0
I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I have n't missed anything ! ||| 0
CONCLUSION : This book may be a good gift for your child ( 10 to 13 years old ) if she has any interest in reading . ||| 0
It could teach him some basic rules and tricks . ||| 0
But if you are looking for speed reading book , this is not the one . ||| 0
