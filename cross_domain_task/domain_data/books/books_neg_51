First of all , this book put me to sleep several times . ||| 0
Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer , but I think she would be better served writing romance novels . ||| 0
Every writer has his or her own writing style , but some styles are simply inappropriate for certain genres . ||| 0
Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings , moods , and thoughts of characters but hey , Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere . ||| 0
It 's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is . ||| 0
Do n't get me wrong I love Shakespere , but I read it when I 'm in the mood for it . ||| 0
When I 'm in the mood for Star Wars , I want Star Wars . ||| 0
What 's wrong with the plot ? ||| 0
Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon . ||| 0
Second , you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero ? ||| 0
Not to worry , BH has a better idea . ||| 0
Very early on in the book Luke gets injured . ||| 0
Over the next 150 or so pages Luke encounters some very trivial obstacles ( for a Jedi that is ) . ||| 0
About every 4 or 5 pages we are told , `` Normally Luke would just use the force to ... raise the box/lift the door/open the lock/fool the guard/take the blaster from the Gamorrean/insert your own obstacle ... but his pain keeps him from focusing the force . ||| 0
Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted . ||| 0
What 's the matter Barbara ? ||| 0
Could n't think of a challenging bad guy ? ||| 0
This was a very cheap substitute . ||| 0
And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques ? ||| 0
Oh but this hurt Luke too bad for Jedi techniques to work . ||| 0
Riiight . ||| 0
; - ) Final analysis : This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ ! ||| 0
Of any kind ! ||| 0
If you *must* read it because it 's `` star wars '' try to get a used one or borrow one . ||| 0
I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow , let alone recruit BH to write a third book . ||| 0
Yuck ! ||| 0
