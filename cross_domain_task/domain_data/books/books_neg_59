Why did I pick up this book ? ||| 0
- because the cover caught my eye and I 'm always interested in urban-fantasy novels where the main protagonist is male ( since that 's very rare ) , especially one from a female author . ||| 0
So that really peaked my interest . ||| 0
The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing , it is amazingly generic . ||| 0
It 's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons , agents of light , vampires , goblins , knights , werewolves and mystical weapons of power , blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on `` how-to '' write an urban-fantasy novel . ||| 0
If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I 'd read it already . ||| 0
The main problem I had with this book is it 's characterization , or lack there of . ||| 0
There 's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work ( the story constantly shifts through multiple POV 's ) , that I felt like I was missing half the novel , like it was incomplete . ||| 0
There 's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre , but that 's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter . ||| 0
I mean you want readers to come back for the rest of the series right ? ||| 0
Also , the two `` main '' characters of the book , Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez ( and yes that 's her real name ! ! ) ||| 0
are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they 're cursory characters in the background , rather then the one 's the whole series is based around . ||| 0
And they both whined and whined so much , especially Gabriel , that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he was n't a freshman in highschool , but already in college ! ! ||| 0

However , I did like the magic system with the witches , warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world , and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house . ||| 0
I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell , and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later . ||| 0
But man , the most important aspect of the story , the very foundation the world is based around , the magical weapons , felt the weakest in the entire story . ||| 0
Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained , their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world . ||| 0
It 's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably wo n't remember the story anymore and sadly I wo n't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt . ||| 0
