This book alleges scandalous , hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel . ||| 0
But all of the book 's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted , and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author , Patrick Tierney , has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books . ||| 0
The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact , unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest , tabloid-calibre book . ||| 0
The book 's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript , and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version , but nope , they all appear to be there . ||| 0
How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher , endorsed by anthropologists , and even be nominated for a National Book Award . ||| 0
If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing , that would be fine . ||| 0
Never mind that it would trash the reputations of the developers of the measles vaccine ( Enders , Katz ) , the world 's most important pioneering geneticist ( Neel ) , and the world 's greatest scientific anthropologist ( Chagnon ) , and cause their friends and families to suffer . ||| 0
Such evidence would deserve an audience nonetheless . ||| 0
But this is not what Tierney does . ||| 0
He distorts his printed sources , omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations , and invents material that is n't actually there ( there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner , although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews ) . ||| 0
And that 's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend ( mission records , interviews , audio tapes , etc . ) . ||| 0
In fact , several of Tierney 's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully . ||| 0
On the positive side , Tierney 's got a smooth narrative style , and the book might make a nice novel . ||| 0
So read it if you want - just consider it fiction . ||| 0
