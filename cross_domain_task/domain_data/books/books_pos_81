Kevin Vanhoozer is the editor of this book which is a compilation of essays about each book of the Old Testament ( OT ) . ||| 1
Each essay is written by a different person who sticks somewhat to a similar pattern . ||| 1
Every author tries to give you a historical look at the interpretation of the book and why it belongs in the canon of Scripture . ||| 1
While I read the book from cover-to-cover , it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT . ||| 1
Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction . ||| 1
His goal in compiling the book is not so one can simply become an intellectual giant , but so that one can learn more about God . ||| 1
In his view , which I strongly agree with , one must invest time learning about God ( the practice of theology ) in order to have a good relationship with Him . ||| 1
However , one must not think knowledge is where our relationship with God ends . ||| 1
Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect . ||| 1
While each author may adapt his style a little differently , the content layout remains the same . ||| 1
* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament , specifically to Jesus . ||| 1
* The book is highly readable . ||| 1
Each author writes in a manner I could describe as pastoral . ||| 1
The goal was to teach the reader , not impress them or bore them . ||| 1
* The book is well researched . ||| 1
Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter . ||| 1
Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a ) other authors and references , or b ) what different theories ( such as JPED ) were . ||| 1
* The book could stand another 100 pages or so . ||| 1
I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information . ||| 1
While a great overview , I think it could have gone a little deeper . ||| 1
* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records . ||| 1
I know , this point is a nitpick . ||| 1
* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer . ||| 1
After his remarkable work on the introduction , I was hoping he would contribute in other places . ||| 1
My conclusion is , this is a great book and would benefit any library . ||| 1
This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on . ||| 1
You could return to it for information over and over again . ||| 1
I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader . ||| 1
I give it 4 out of 5 stars . ||| 1
Good work . ||| 1
