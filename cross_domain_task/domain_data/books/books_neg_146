I read it and quite frankly I 'm less than impressed . ||| 0
The author 's ability to write is somewhat limited . ||| 0
He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great , but being a soldier does n't make you a poet . ||| 0
I only hope that the recent programs to help the auto industry can help him keep his day job at Chrysler . ||| 0
Maybe his next book will improve . ||| 0
