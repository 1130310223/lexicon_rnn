We know why this book was honored with the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Award for science/technical writing . ||| 1
Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science ( even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it ) . ||| 1
But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling , and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright , curious children to understand their world . ||| 1
He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate . ||| 1
To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team . ||| 1
( The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt . ||| 1
Everest ascent : the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves , right alongside the adventurers they 're filming . ) ||| 1
Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do . ||| 1
In his book , he captivates us by telling us what his `` characters '' know how to do . ||| 1
From the fox who knows how to skitter across a thin sheet of newly-forming ice without falling through , to the native who knows how to take compass readings by studying the shadows on snow drifts , to our generation 's academic elites who know how to wrap their minds around the infinitely complex equations that underlie the mysteries of climate change . ||| 1
In the end , it 's really not so mysterious : the signs of climate change are obvious and all around us . ||| 1
Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened , just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives , livelihoods , and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself . ||| 1
