Michael Behe has stated ( in interviews ) that he does not agree with a 'materialist ' explanation of nature . ||| 0
Materialism means that we take the view that only forces and matter are what determine physical phenomena . ||| 0
Behe takes the view that something else is involved - something best described as Supernatural . ||| 0
Yet there has been no repeatable experiment ( eg prayer freezes water ) to demonstrate a non-materialist position . ||| 0
But get this ... ||| 0
Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena , they would keep that discovery a secret ! ||| 0
First of all , it is open to anybody , not just scientists , to show that materialism it not a complete explanation . ||| 0
And to hint that scientists are keeping ( or would keep ) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about . ||| 0
Science is about empiricism . ||| 0
It 's just that so far , nothing at a basic , repeatable level , has demonstrated anything other than matter and forces are at work . ||| 0
Arguments for design always start at the top ( complex systems ) , which misses the point completely . ||| 0
Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom ( simple repeated experiments ) , and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary . ||| 0
Until he , or anyone else , can do so , it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design . ||| 0
