The only reason that I read this book was because someone very close to me asked me to . ||| 0
It was terrible . ||| 0
I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved , so much so that I decided to write my first review . ||| 0
Let me substantiate my claim : 1 . ||| 0
It is historically inaccurate . ||| 0
It is not historical fiction , it is fiction . ||| 0
Check up on the information , rather than absorbing it unthinkingly ! ||| 0
2 . ||| 0
The shallowness of the characters made me cringe . ||| 0
As I read the other reviews on this site , I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people 's literary tastes and excited their emotions . ||| 0
The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me . ||| 0
3 . ||| 0
The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader . ||| 0
Again , I was outraged . ||| 0
4 . ||| 0
( NB : I am neither a Jew nor an Arab ) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author . ||| 0
This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism ' , in Exodus , all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being , while the heroic , courageous , morally upright , ( superior race ! ) ||| 0
Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs : just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil ' and 'inferior ' Polish who were occupying 'their ' land . ||| 0
5 . ||| 0
This is a direct quote from the book : `` Jew hating is an incurable disease '' . ||| 0
Well , I guess I am very sick along with millions of others , somehow repressing my pathological need to hate Jews , and its only a matter of time until my 'incurable ' subconscious hatred manifests itself . ||| 0
Or maybe we are dealing in pathetic and gross generalizations and being emotionally manipulative , with an obvious disregard for reality . ||| 0
You do n't have to like my review or agree with me , but I challenge you to really read the book , not just swallow it . ||| 0
It wo n't taste nice , and its a bore . ||| 0
