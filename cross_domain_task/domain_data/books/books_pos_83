The X and Y of Buy is a book about gender marketing . ||| 1
Author Elizabeth Pace uses the scientific differences between men and women to help sales associates and entrepreneurs learn the best practices for dealing with different genders . ||| 1
the premise is ; if you can market properly to men and women , you will be able to increase sales and expand your business . ||| 1
I really enjoyed this book . ||| 1
Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender . ||| 1
She tells us things like men are more driven and strait forward when it comes to sales . ||| 1
They do not want interruptions and need to get right to the point . ||| 1
Women , on the other hand , want more connection and community when it comes to business relationships . ||| 1
Women will deal with ( or add to ) the conversations and interruptions if it means a group can come to a consensus . ||| 1
The only place I found this book lacking was in the `` spiritual content '' department . ||| 1
Thomas Nelson is a Christian publisher and prides itself on having a spiritual message . ||| 1
If they did not , I would not be picking at this point . ||| 1
It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics . ||| 1
Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting ( trust me , I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting ) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today . ||| 1
Overall , it was a good book . ||| 1
I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that `` ah-ha ! '' ||| 1
moment as I found something that related both to business practices , and my personal relationships . ||| 1
I give this book 4 out of five stars . ||| 1
