It 's been four years since I read the book ... ||| 1
and four years since I 've had serious chronic back pain . ||| 1
My worst days now are like my best days used to be . ||| 1
I 'm the biggest cynic on the planet , and had been shown xrays and MRIs showing why my back caused me pain . ||| 1
Chiropractors , Orthopedists , and others tried to help and never did . ||| 1
Then I read this book , gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone . ||| 1
Weird but true . ||| 1
Try it , give it a shot , and for a few bucks you may find that you 've got your back back ! ||| 1
