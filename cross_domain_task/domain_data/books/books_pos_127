Communication in marriage is a challenge . ||| 1
I am grateful , then , for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs ' book , The Language of Love and Respect : Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate ( Thomas Nelson ) . ||| 1
In it , Dr. Eggerichs expands the principles in his best-seller Love and Respect , and offers practical steps for couples . ||| 1
My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years ... some good , some bad , and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan ... but Love and Respect is our favorite , by far . ||| 1
It just makes sense . ||| 1
Biblical sense . ||| 1
Dr. Eggerichs bases his communication solution on Ephesians 5:33 : `` Each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband . '' ||| 1
A woman 's greatest need is unconditional love , while a man 's is unconditional respect . ||| 1
`` Yes , the two of you are very different , '' Eggerichs writes , from God 's perspective , `` and I am telling you to love and respect unconditionally anyway . '' ||| 1
Good communication in marriage is n't easy . ||| 1
It takes work , and grace , and power from beyond ourselves . ||| 1
But the biblical , practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another 's language , and grow a God-honoring marriage . ||| 1
