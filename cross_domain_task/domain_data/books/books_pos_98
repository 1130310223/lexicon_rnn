The book is short in duration , easy to read , direct in nature , often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech . ||| 1
It is an easy read , but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context . ||| 1
Regardless the era , the subject matter is relevant ( Corporate crime ) . ||| 1
Other subjects may be more evident in our day than when first written , such as the manipulation of government officials by corporations for profits as with the US coalition and NATO armed forces current day practice of hiring private soldiers and service contractors as an integral part of their main fighting forces . ||| 1
This book is not anti-war , but anti-corruption and anti-interventionalist ( anti-imperialism ) and bemoans the abuse , destruction of so many good men/women ( soldiers ) both physically and mentally and the burden on society as a whole for the grossly disproportionate financial profits of a very few ( olygarcy ) whom by their very same actions should be considered quite unpatriotic . ||| 1
The book details the oppinion of a career military officer , a politically appointed general . ||| 1
The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit ' . ||| 1
Although oppinion , the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced . ||| 1
True dialog is missing . ||| 1
The weakness of some aurguments , such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts . ||| 1
Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs , but considering the authors rank , status , 'need to know ' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions . ||| 1
The author often argues using emoutional language and metaphor . ||| 1
The naming of corporate sponsor of war as murderers is avoided but could be a concievable conclusion . ||| 1
Although critical of the illegal gains and abuses in which the author was paticipatory , this work is in no way an apology , nor a repentance for a full military career served . ||| 1
Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty . ||| 1
The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier , having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal ( No longer issued , akin to the Medal of Honor ) . ||| 1
Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain , having run for political office and political activism . ||| 1
The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine , but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author . ||| 1
Regardless , the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense ( which said practices are used for economic coercion ) . ||| 1
The author insists bulling , coercion and imposition of other soveriegn nations ( Imperialism ) for corporate interests is immoral , conter-productive to national progress and contradictory to American values , especially when the uncoerced outcomes would result in the same benefits without the high costs of war ( men , material , prestige ) . ||| 1
These high costs are the profits which feed the corporate war profiteering ( aka racketeering ) . ||| 1
This book is useful for younger audiences . ||| 1
There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally . ||| 1
This book is a good example of how courageous personal action ( whistle blowing ) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called `` civil disobedience '' for righteous causes . ||| 1
This book may be used to compare examples of civil rights abuses faced during 'McCarthism ' , the Civil Rights movement and the 'Patriot Act ' . ||| 1
I recomend this book among others such as `` Collateral Damage '' by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services . ||| 1
The graphic images from `` The Horror of It '' seem tame by today 's standards . ||| 1
They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine . ||| 1
At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical , moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts . ||| 1
The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war : that their is much lacking in it 's purpose , morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering . ||| 1
For many it will confirm that `` War is a Racket '' ( The author explains exactly what he means by this statment ) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition . ||| 1
For those who are locked in patriotic vigor for a military action based on a percieved 'just cause ' , this testimony may add insight to a larger view of the possible reasons for why a nation would consider lingering in an unwanted , economically depleating and physically exhausting war considered long overdue to end . ||| 1
Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches ' , some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor : both revealing the varied manipulation of their 's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others ( most likely those in leadership positions ) . ||| 1
The titles subtext of `` Anti-war classic '' is a bit misleading . ||| 1
The author was a career soldier who was politically appointed to general and excecuted his work so throughly well that he was decorated with high honors on multiple occasions and was an advocated for an impenetrable national defense . ||| 1
A better subtext for this work may be 'Taking the Profit Out of War ' or 'Raising the Standard for Going to War ' for the basic principles of the general was to reveal the manipulation of foreign governments by means of force , utilizing the full and combined powers of the United States armed forces and economic base in support of the gross avarice , greed and collusion of private corporate designs ; both sides being aided and assisted by the economically and sensationalistically competative media propaganda machines . ||| 1
After reading this short book , I am reminded that it is often flattery and not fact that decieves us from the truth for which oppinion is truth enough for faith to act . ||| 1
I am remined of those with whom I live , from my own generation , who would cover their lies without accounting and how many of these sorts have risen to political power . ||| 1
I am reminded that the power of an individuals vote STILL provides the ultimate means of power ... that we are provide the means to our own ends and that our progress still remains within our hands , the means by which to thwart abuses of power and coruption and for setting higher standards living and accountability . ||| 1
This book supports my belief that it is vital to have a strong national defense in such a dangerous world , but that power does not need to equate to coercion , manipulation or abuse of others . ||| 1
I was inspired by the idea of the practical application of taking the incentives out of what should be called murder for profit or at least racketeering . ||| 1
Unless one can remember a bullies punch to the stomach in exchange for lunch money , Americans are fortunate to be free from feelings such imposed injustices . ||| 1
I am impressed even more that justice , liberty , freedom and democracy can not function without a free , independant and vibrant media and that without such journalism to report the relevant and current facts to the people 'en mass ' , democracy can not endure , let alone thrive . ||| 1
I am reminded that corporations are not patriotic and that profits do not express the true progress of a people and nation . ||| 1
I am impressed and amazed at how many of the most sinister of terms found in our vocabulary ( racketeering , facism , coercion , murder ) have lost our fear and concern . ||| 1
I 'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review . ||| 1
I am upon writting this rewiew , impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity . ||| 1
It reminds me that if someone needs to try so hard to convince you about somethin ' , that there must be somethin ' wrong with it in the first place : the truth just seems to ring true . ||| 1
Propoganda is for sugar coatin ' what is unadvisable . ||| 1
Encouragement is the only thing needed to motivate a good person to a just cause ... to do something difficult . ||| 1
I would say this book encourages . ||| 1
This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read ' and worthy of referencing current political , business and military discussions . ||| 1
