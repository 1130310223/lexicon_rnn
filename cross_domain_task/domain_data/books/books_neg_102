Impeaching Mere Creationism is an attempt to debunk the intelligent design and creation movements . ||| 0
The effectiveness of the book is accurately revealed when Frymire admitted that he had never read a creationist book until he read Johnson 's Defeating Darwinism . ||| 0
Then he read two other of Johnson 's books , and wrote the book being reviewed here . ||| 0
I have read several hundred books on creationism , both pro and con , and am not yet ready to write a book on creationism ( although I have written 20 books so far , and have published several hundred articles , mostly on biology , my field ) . ||| 0
Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page . ||| 0
This will be obvious to an informed creationists . ||| 0
And evolutionists wonder why they are ineffective in converting creationists ! ||| 0
Many of Frymire 's conclusions are naive , and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists . ||| 0
As they say , a man who has read one book is dangerous . ||| 0
One could add , one who has read 3 paperbacks by one creationists ( and ignored the thousands of others by thousands of other creationists ) is dangerous . ||| 0
The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire 's errors , and as a result will confuse the whole subject area . ||| 0
To find out what is true will then be even more difficult . ||| 0
This reminds me of the false rumor spread for so long that the Procter and Gamble symbol has something to do with demonism . ||| 0
They finally gave up trying to squash the rumor and dumped the symbol . ||| 0
In short this book will do more harm than good . ||| 0
