Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it . ||| 0
I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one , where real world facts blend into fiction . ||| 0
However , I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir . ||| 0
He was to cowardly , so childish throughout his whole life , whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story . ||| 0
While the villian of the book was truly a villian , at least he understood who he was . ||| 0
Amir never figures out who he is until much later in his life . ||| 0
I never felt bad once for Amir , but I loathed him even to the end . ||| 0
And that 's why I could not enjoy this novel more . ||| 0
I could n't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with . ||| 0
I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible . ||| 0
Perhaps that 's where the crux of the problem actually is . ||| 0
By having too simple a writing style , the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier . ||| 0
Overall , this is a book that can be read while riding the train to and from work in a matter of a day or two . ||| 0
However , I do not recommend this , because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice . ||| 0
