Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict , but readers should use caution against potential bias . ||| 1
During his time in Chechnya , the author seems to have grown quite affectionate toward the Chechens . ||| 1
This leads to the Russians being painted as the villain ( not that they are angels , but neither are the Chechens ) . ||| 1
However , Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war . ||| 1
I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war . ||| 1
This book is not for beginners , but few Yale publishings are . ||| 1
Beginnners should look for a Chechnya book from a mass-market publisher . ||| 1
