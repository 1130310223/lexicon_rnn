Readers of Dean Koontz 's Frankenstein have been anticipating the final volume in the series for years . ||| 0
It was n't worth the wait . ||| 0
Released late last month , Dead and Alive wraps up the author 's modernization of the Frankenstein story four years later than originally planned . ||| 0
Reasons for the delay include Koontz 's dislike of working with co-authors ( both of whose names have been dropped from new printings of books one and two ) to the effect of the real-life Hurricane Katrina on the story 's New Orleans setting . ||| 0
Somewhere between 2005 and now , Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously : What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce , complete with a naked , dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy . ||| 0
Only Deucalion , Victor 's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating , is still played straight . ||| 0
Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles , nattering on about raising babies ( they 're now in love ) , eating and shooting guns . ||| 0
A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a `` perky butt '' -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two . ||| 0
The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end . ||| 0
They would have been just as appropriately armed with rubber-band guns and paper clips . ||| 0
Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters , a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump . ||| 0
He even sets up a possible sequel and makes a connection to his popular Odd Thomas series . ||| 0
But it 's too little , too late . ||| 0
After 352 relentlessly padded pages ( I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor 's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads ) , the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line , a pale shadow of what it could have been . ||| 0
