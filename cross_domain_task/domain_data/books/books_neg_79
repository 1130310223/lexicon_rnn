I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review . ||| 0
Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam , but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas . ||| 0
The selling point ( I thought ) in the REA book was the `` Six full length practice exams '' it advertises . ||| 0
Though these tests are long , the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions . ||| 0
Most only require the student to know a definition . ||| 0
The essay questions are acceptable , but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources ( like the Princeton Review ) this book simply gives example essays . ||| 0
The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy . ||| 0
The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test . ||| 0
This book does have lots of questions on US History , but I would recommend using free resources ( like old AP tests ) over purchasing this book . ||| 0
Better yet , get yourself the Princeton Review book ! ||| 0
