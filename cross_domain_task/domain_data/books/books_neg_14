I began this novel with the greatest of hopes , and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of . ||| 0
It is the story of a man in a mid-western town and a full description of every person he has ever met in the town . ||| 0
It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but did n't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book . ||| 0
Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot ( if there was one ) was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book . ||| 0
The relationship between Michael ( the main character ) and Angela ( a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter ) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy . ||| 0
When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting , the discovery of an alien corridor , he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend . ||| 0
When he gets back to the corridor he is ready to dive in , and when he does so begins the only salvageable part of the book . ||| 0
Note to author : Reading does n't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment . ||| 0
They say to write what you know , but keep in mind that plot is EVERYTHING , without one you are just meandering about frustrating your reader . ||| 0
