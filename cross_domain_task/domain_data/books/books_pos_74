Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson , M.Ed . ||| 1
[ ... ] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook , this book is just what the recession ordered . ||| 1
The book tells one how to `` get paid '' in a spiritual way . ||| 1
The book proclaims that the Economic Revolution is the third phase of freedom after the Civil Rights Revolution . ||| 1
Economic Revolution is the methodology in which we go from where we are now ( economic turmoil ) to where we are financially independent in God 's world . ||| 1
It 's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current . ||| 1
Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis . ||| 1
Some may see it as flip flopping while others may see it as a testament to the author 's growth that he begins the book with an attitude that some may perceive to be that of an angry black man . ||| 1
He ends the book in what some might perceive as a kinder gentler African-American Republican , who believes that the American dream is possible for anyone who is willing to pick themselves up by their boot straps . ||| 1
Some may find that concept hard to buy , especially if they do n't even own a pair of boots . ||| 1
Still it 's clear that the author loves his `` people , '' and all races of people , as he gives solid advice to young , black men as to selling drugs -- he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage . ||| 1
He tells them why it 's important for all people to learn a trade and become engaged in politics . ||| 1
This slim book is an interesting quick read . ||| 1
Hopefully in the future the author will considering updating and fattening up the book -- to expand on his ideas . ||| 1
