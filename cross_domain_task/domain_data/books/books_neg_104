I was very curious to read this book because of all the hype . ||| 0
While I support the author 's message , I found two mayor flaws in her writing . ||| 0
The first being that her ego pervades the whole book , dominates and deludes the message . ||| 0
The whole point of the power of the sacred feminine and the path of truth , is that you surrender your ego , look outside yourself by going deeply within , and realize the universal power of the Goddess that lies within all women , and is half of the force which drives men , and provides the connective glue of the universe . ||| 0
By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion , making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her , she shows that she just does n't get it . ||| 0
It 's not all about ME ! ||| 0
Secondly , I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality . ||| 0
I could forgive it if like Dan Brown or some similar lesser talented Romance novelists ; she had made up for it by mastering pacing and suspense . ||| 0
But the Oh , my gosh ! ||| 0
factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon . ||| 0
I 'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page . ||| 0
As in the scene where they puzzle over the meaning of the Scorpion in the painting . ||| 0
I wanted to scream , It 's a zodiac sign for Scorpio you dolts ! ||| 0
If you want to read a novel that truly empowers women and clearly states the path that celebrates the power of the Goddess , I suggest R. Douglas Weber 's Solomon 's Key : The CODIS Project . ||| 0
It pulls no punches regarding the demonizing of the sacred feminine , and tells a tale of how even the true rituals of Goddess empowerment have been corrupted by men , who like Ms. McGowan , have fallen into the ego trap . ||| 0
From Solomon 's Key : They believed that sex , the sacred chemical wedding is the key or bridge to God or the cosmos . ||| 0
The Old Testament 's Song of Solomon is a path working guide to the hidden corridor . ||| 0
Mary Magdalene , like all women , was the opener of the way , the sexual initiatrix . ||| 0
To female readers I say that Within each of us is the power of the Divine Mother . ||| 0
Goddess Power is about coming into that power , owning that power and learning how to use that power by an unselfish surrender of oneself , not by ego . ||| 0
