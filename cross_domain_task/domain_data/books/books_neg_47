Having just finished a long journey through `` The Cloister Walk '' I do not consider myself at all qualified to provide an objective review of `` The Psalms '' . ||| 0
But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms , the saints , the Church , on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world.. ||| 0
which was so very prominent in her `` Walk '' is missing . ||| 0
To compare is , of course , patently unfair . ||| 0
However , in my opinion a book 's value is not in merely restating what has already been written , but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is . ||| 0
This does not happen . ||| 0
Shame on the publishers ! ||| 0
