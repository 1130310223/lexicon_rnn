This is the worst port I 've played in a long time . ||| 0
And I thought Mass Effect was bad . ||| 0
By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece . ||| 0
The controls are lousy . ||| 0
You can not access menus through use of the mouse , which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail . ||| 0
The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping . ||| 0
Miserable to play throughout . ||| 0
The graphics are crummy , and despite having crossfired graphics cards ( HD4870s ) . ||| 0
I ca n't get decent frames no matter what . ||| 0
I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis , and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics . ||| 0
Other problems include common clipping issues , buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere , and the worst skins I 've seen on character models since 2004 . ||| 0
The models are sloppy , robotic looking , and frankly ugly . ||| 0
Enemies get frozen in space , stuck in doorways , etc ... ||| 0
It 's so bad it 's amateurish . ||| 0
The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable . ||| 0
Do n't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC . ||| 0
It will frustrate you , anger you , and make you want to chuck the game in the trash . ||| 0
It can not be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC . ||| 0
I do n't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable . ||| 0
Do n't buy under any circumstances . ||| 0
