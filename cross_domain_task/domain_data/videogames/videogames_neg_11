`` Disastrous '' WOW , after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history . ||| 0
Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help . ||| 0
The game is jerky , the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat , combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding . ||| 0
Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on . ||| 0
I do n't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak does n't get the option to make any more games . ||| 0
Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments . ||| 0
STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS ... DO N'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID ! ! ||| 0
