I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan , but this one really disappointed me . ||| 1
Do n't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon , because Natsume , the company who created all the HM games , took of the major part of the game : interacting with others . ||| 1
So this game is a complete failure ? ||| 1
No , of course not ! ||| 1
It 's still a great game , but not the best HM game ever made : they could have made it better . ||| 1
Why ? ||| 1
Read this . ||| 1
Gameplay Not a very good gameplay , unlike other Harvest Moon , but still some good points . ||| 1
The original Harvest Moon for SNES was great , I played it at my friend 's house and I really loved it ! ||| 1
You could wander around in the village , climb up the mountain , make friends and get one of the five village girl to marry you . ||| 1
In this game , they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special . ||| 1
Harvest Moon games , basically , are farming games . ||| 1
I say basically , because they 're much , much more than that . ||| 1
You can interact with all the villagers ( sometimes even marry girls ) and run around to explore your little village and its surroundings while participating in some really fun festivals ! ||| 1
This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special , and they took it all off ! ||| 1
The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites , located right under your shed . ||| 1
However , they almost always say the same phrase everyday , and they 're not very talkative ( ) . ||| 1
As for the mountain , there is simply none ! ||| 1
The village still exists , of course , but you can only go shopping there : the shopkeepers are only pictures , not persons , and you ca n't move around in the shop . ||| 1
All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you . ||| 1
There are still 5-6 festivals , but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers ( only way you can interact with them , but they always say the same things ) . ||| 1
At your farm , the only place ( beside festivals ) you can move around , all you do is care about your farm . ||| 1
You can have a little fun riding your horse , if you like that ||| 1
You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time , which is not much . ||| 1
But , the games still have it good points ! ||| 1
After befriending the Harvest Sprites , they will actually work for you while you sleep ! ||| 1
This new function is really cool , the game continues while you are not even playing ! ||| 1
Also , if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots , cabbages , turnips , eggplants , grass , whatever of the many vegetables available , you have plenty of space to work on , 'cause your field is really large ! ||| 1
Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer , a boy farmer , a pet cat or a pet dog ! ||| 1
Control : I ca n't say they 're bad ; in fact they 're pretty easy to use , if only you could carry more things , but they 're really good ! ||| 1
This is about it for the gameplay part , but I wo n't give it a high score , it 's not really good . ||| 1
Score : 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad , in fact , I 'd say they 're pretty good . ||| 1
Especially the shopkeepers , they 're very well designed when you see them in the shops . ||| 1
Even though they 're like pictures they still look great like this ! ||| 1
Everything is well colored . ||| 1
People do look like people ! ||| 1
Still , as good they may be , the cows really look bad in this game . ||| 1
But that 's the only detail I can think of , because , for a Gameboy game , they did pretty well for the graphics ! ||| 1
Not perfect graphics , but extremely good graphics ! ||| 1
Score : 9/10 Music In one word : repetitive ! ||| 1
! ||| 1
The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them ; they 're slow ! ||| 1
If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing , day after day , hour after hour , why did n't they take their time and compose some good music , like the Summer and Fall ones ? ||| 1
Those are good , and they wo n't bother you before a long time . ||| 1
But , it 's like that with all of the Harvest Moons ||| 1
I do n't know , give us something nice to hear , that makes you want to move around ! ||| 1
With 5-6 different tunes in the game , that you keep hearing overand overandover ! ||| 1
! ||| 1
Whatever the season , the music , you will get sick to hear it , so take off the sound on your Gameboy , choose one of your favourite songs , find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game ! ||| 1
Score- 3.5/10 Story- Your dead grandfather 's spirit comes one day to tell you to take over his neglected farm ||| 1
All HM have a story like that , but this time it 's actually your grandpa 's ghost who asks you himself to take over his farm , so it 's a bit different . ||| 1
It 's not a bad story , but it 's really not a super exciting story . ||| 1
Score : 5/10 Play Time / Replayability Like long games ? ||| 1
This game is really , really long ! ||| 1
How long ? ||| 1
Well , it 's infinite ! ||| 1
You will surely want to play 1 year , at least . ||| 1
Two years , until you are Ranch Master . ||| 1
Another year to gain another time the title of Ranch Master . ||| 1
The fourth year , to fully accomplish your job , and get the umbrella . ||| 1
But after that ||| 1
Surely you will look for more challenge , if you have played until the fourth year ( I did n't ) you should be bored by now . ||| 1
The play time is infinite , but nothing really different will happen after the first year , so it 's up to you . ||| 1
Score : 8/10 Final Score : 7/10 So ||| 1
it 's not a good game . ||| 1
It 's not a really bad game . ||| 1
But if you have money for one more HM , do n't buy this one , it 's the worst of them all . ||| 1
Compared to the other HM , it 's no good . ||| 1
Compared to some other games I played , it can rocks . ||| 1
But Rent before buying ||| 1
If you like it , buy it and be prepared to become a hard-working farmer , or even a Ranch Master : P ||| 1
