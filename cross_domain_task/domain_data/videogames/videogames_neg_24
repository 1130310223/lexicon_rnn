At first it was ok . ||| 0
You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults . ||| 0
I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers . ||| 0
You 'd then battle `` ancient evils '' in the name of good . ||| 0
These ancient evils would be evil gods and monsters , and their minions would be men , snakes , and dogs ( rabid dogs , not puppies ) . ||| 0
What I did n't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first . ||| 0
You always had the same weapons , techniques , and the minions would always act the same ! ||| 0
They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere ! ||| 0
Then the bosses were n't even historically accurate , and it did n't take a historian to figure that out ! ||| 0
The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa , so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones ! ||| 0
So to sum it up : OK : The graphics ( on a scale of 1 to ten ; 4 ) The music ( it was ok , but not awe in spiring ) BAD : The weapons ( there were only four different kinds , and one type of shield ) The bosses ( Egyptian and Greek Gods DO N'T mix ! ) ||| 0
The levels ( the same thing over and over ) The minions ( they always acted the same , like they just had different skins or something ) I would n't recommend buying this game for someone with experience , but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ( $ 5 or less ) then maybe consider it . ||| 0
