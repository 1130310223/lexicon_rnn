`` Disappointing '' I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days . ||| 0
I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was . ||| 0
This game 's challenge is to make a town into a five star town but to do this you must make items for your sims and houses throughout the whole game and find essences . ||| 0
This game also does n't have a lot of building items , after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same . ||| 0
My friend had said before I bought it to do n't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and did n't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it . ||| 0
Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also do n't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character . ||| 0
I was highly disapointed with this game . ||| 0
