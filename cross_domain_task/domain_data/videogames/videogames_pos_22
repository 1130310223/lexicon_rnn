`` Revolutionary '' Halo was one of those games you can not live without . ||| 1
It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature . ||| 1
One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC . ||| 1
Its graphics could have been a little bit better , but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles . ||| 1
I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2 . ||| 1
They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak . ||| 1
I am awaiting Halo 3 and they showed Cheif holding the assault rifle which will be a great addition . ||| 1
I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down , it will not spawn until the next match . ||| 1
