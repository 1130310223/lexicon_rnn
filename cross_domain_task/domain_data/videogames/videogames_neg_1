Purchased this with expectations that the mini-games would be easy to get into and fun . ||| 0
After trying them out , I can only describe them as tedious . ||| 0
Every game seems to have 10 or so `` intro '' screens that you have to go through . ||| 0
To make matters worse , there are different ways to get through the intro screens . ||| 0
Some require pushing A , others you have to select options with the cursor then click A , others require jumping to get a random dice roll . ||| 0
Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again . ||| 0
This may be fun for some occasions , but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy . ||| 0
