Here 's the deal . ||| 0
This game has a few things going for it . ||| 0
It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings . ||| 0
I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down . ||| 0
The single player has some moments that are kind of funny . ||| 0
The graphics are not on par with the great shooters , but they are still pretty good . ||| 0
My complaints with the game are as follows . ||| 0
Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph , 3 mph if I am sprinting . ||| 0
The graphics are not all that great . ||| 0
The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate . ||| 0
Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid . ||| 0
Like the injector that heals you , which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself . ||| 0
This would n't be so bad if I was n't using the damn thing every 10 seconds . ||| 0
Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again . ||| 0
What 's the point of that ? ||| 0
If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again . ||| 0
Also the multiplayer sucks , blow up gold crates ... . ||| 0
Whatever . ||| 0
I hear they are releasing new modes , but who cares when the game play is this bad . ||| 0
Anyways , maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4 . ||| 0
But it feels like they rushed this game out . ||| 0
I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall . ||| 0
