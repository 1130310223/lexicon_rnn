I 'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first , so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks `` realistic '' or because it looks like a `` simulation '' might be deterred . ||| 0
The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things : You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences ( huh ? ||| 0
) , haybails , and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad . ||| 0
This is all in a game which claims to let you use `` Real Military Tactics . '' ||| 0
Ridiculous stuff . ||| 0
The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions . ||| 0
Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints ? ||| 0
Basically , you can not crawl on the ground or go prone , so using dips in the terrain is not too common . ||| 0
The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for `` real '' cover , but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you . ||| 0
I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game . ||| 0
Come on - you do n't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces , so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin ? ||| 0
No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on , unless it was his last and only place to try and hide . ||| 0
The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America 's Army , so it 's at least up to par in that area . ||| 0
The sound effects are great and accurate , making it seem like you 're in a movie ( the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming ) . ||| 0
The visuals and firefights seem great as well , grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive . ||| 0
As for commanding the squad , it is easy and is a great idea , but the tactics are always the same : pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy , as there is usually only one route to do so . ||| 0
The game does n't offer large , open terrain , but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate , much like Call Of Duty . ||| 0
That normally is n't a problem when it is disguised well , but regardless , it gets old . ||| 0
This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin ' for . ||| 0
