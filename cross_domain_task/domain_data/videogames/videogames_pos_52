NG2 does n't disapoint ! ||| 1
It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action ! ||| 1
I 'm still on the first level but so far I can yell : THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA ! ||| 1
It is just perfect ! ||| 1
Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick ( and you can adjust the speed of it at any time ) . ||| 1
The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time . ||| 1
I did n't experience any slow downs or others issues . ||| 1
So far , so good , I 'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous , Itakagi is my man , too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games ... ||| 1
