Well , I am a big fan of Western Shoot em up movies , and ... well ... pretty much any shoot em up movie will do ... One of my favorites was ''Last Man Standing '' ... Anyways to the game ! ||| 1
Well , I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk ... .I thought it was fun , and shelled out the $ 20 dollars for it ... I loved every minute of the game ! ||| 1
Graphics : 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character ... .But , I guess in the time this came out ... which was I believe '97 ... ..these graphics still were n't top noch ... .Oh well ... I do n't judge games by graphics ... .Although ... The cut scenes were fantastic ! ||| 1
A nice western-cartoon feel ! ||| 1
They bring the rating up from a six , since the cut scenes do n't last long . ||| 1
Story : 8/10 ( same as pretty much any western type anything ) You are a former marshal ... .Bad ass dude ... Well , a bunch of people want your land , along with all the land surrounding you ... You kept refusing , so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies , and your wife 's perfume , they murder your wife , burn down your house , and kidnap your kid ! ||| 1
Well ... .You do what any badass ex-marshal would do ; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu ... nevermind ... .You just kill em all . ||| 1
Better than most FPS ( exception ; BLOOD ! ) ||| 1
Challenge : 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing ... and challenging ... .The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor ... The enemies are pretty simple ... Just go out there , move around , and if you are good enough , you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them ... .. ||| 1
Controls : 10/10 Your usual for a FPS ... ..You get your regular fire , then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns ... you also got your open doors button ... then your move buttons ... and map ... and jump ... and so on . ||| 1
You really ca n't complain about the controls , since you can modify them to your liking . ||| 1
Sounds and Music : 7/10 Well , the sound is fantastic ! ||| 1
The voices are done well ! ||| 1
The gunshots are ... near perfect ... ..there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends ... .Then the music ... Your very great western music ! ||| 1
DUH ! ! ! ||| 1
IT 'S A FU ... FREAKING WESTERN GAME ! ! ||| 1
! ||| 1
Though ... After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music , it gets boring ... and annoying ... and after the whole game , the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels ... I think ... .Maybe it 's the same track in every level ... ||| 1
Replay Value : 6/10 Depends ... .You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody ... .I ca n't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer ... ..Anyways ... .If you wait a few years and play it again ... Or you might just wan na kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style ... . ||| 1
Originality : 9/10 It 's been a while since there 's been a western-like FPS ... actually ... .I ca n't remember any other ... Well there is probably another Western FPS I 've played , just this was the most memorable ... . ||| 1
In conclusion , I give this game an 8/10 ... .It 's a really good game ... .seriously ... .The best western game I 've ever played ... .It 's got a nice story ( for an fps ) , and all sorts of other junk ... This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover ... .Hell , it 's even good for people who are n't fans of the genre ||| 1
