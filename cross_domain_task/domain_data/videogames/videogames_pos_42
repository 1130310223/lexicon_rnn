`` Just plain fun '' I do n't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs . ||| 1
I fail to see the new flaws to it that make it worse . ||| 1
Story : You are a person looking for a dog , so you go to the local kennel and pick out your new best virtual friend ! ||| 1
After that there is no real story to it , so I 'm not going to rate it upon story . ||| 1
Difficulty : That actually depends upon the dog that you pick out and it 's personality . ||| 1
If it says that it is calm or something like that , it would be like to easy difficulty , but if he is naughty and needed lots of training , it would be the hard difficulty . ||| 1
It 's like the teams in Sonic Heroes , only the system works better . ||| 1
8.5/10 Graphics : The graphics almost look lifelike . ||| 1
The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly , the dog 's body animations feel perfect . ||| 1
I also have n't encountered any drops in the game 's frame rate . ||| 1
10/10 Controls : You 'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game , by throwing things , rubbing your stylus on your dog 's head to pet them , and showing them how to do tricks . ||| 1
10/10 Overall , I do n't see why this game got a lower score than the others . ||| 1
It 's just as fun . ||| 1
I do n't think people should dock it points because it 's the same game . ||| 1
The second game that was released was n't docked any points . ||| 1
Why 's that ? ||| 1
9/10 . ||| 1
Great Job ! ||| 1
