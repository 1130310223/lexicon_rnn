look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty . ||| 0
im not even a hard core gamer , more of a casual one . ||| 0
i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time . ||| 0
not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game , after u get that its boring . ||| 0
so again , i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it . ||| 0
its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well , u beat it in the first 2 hours . ||| 0
