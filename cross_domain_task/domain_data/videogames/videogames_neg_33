Very rarely do you come across a game like this , and I 'm extremely glad for this . ||| 0
The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series , is probably the worst , and later on , becomes physically painful to play . ||| 0
Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game , the graphics are nothing amazing , but nothing extremely horrible . ||| 0
Story : 1/10 Here 's where things start to go bad . ||| 0
You get woken up one night by your father , and he tells you about the 77 pieces of ''Magi '' spread across the world , that when put together form a statue . ||| 0
You , obviously , go in search of them . ||| 0
Normally I do n't have problems with simple stories , but when combined with the monotony of the quest , you 'd think they would have written a better story , to keep you interested . ||| 0
Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad , typical GameBoy RPG controls , you 'll get used to them very quickly . ||| 0
Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around , you have to battle against other monsters , and buy weapons/armour , like any other game . ||| 0
The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level '' you just randomly gain stats , which gets annoying , since you have to spend so much more time ''level '' building , than any other RPG I 've played . ||| 0
And when you get to the later levels , and the monsters are extremely tough , this becomes even more annoying , with the limited weapons use . ||| 0
You have say ''hit points '' for each weapon , for example : You equip a sword , and it can only be used 15 times before breaking . ||| 0
Now , of course , as you continue onwards , you find that weapons become even more expensive , and slowly begin having less , and less hit points , so when you do want to ''level '' up , you have to get new weapons every several battles , just to keep leveling up , which takes all your gold , which means to do anything else you need to go fight ... . ||| 0
it 's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters . ||| 0
Luckily , you do run into a few ''super '' weapons that do n't have any ''hit points '' but they 're very few , and by the time you find them , you 've probably already grown sick of this game , and thrown it against a wall . ||| 0
Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games , is the overly ''sad '' music . ||| 0
Normally , I do n't complain about music , but in most games , the tunes are at least halfway decent , and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute . ||| 0
But with FFL2 , the music just is so repetitive , and melancholy , even during the ''happy '' parts of this game . ||| 0
Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once , trust me , you 'll never want to go through it again . ||| 0
Rental/Purchase ? ||| 0
Unless you really adored the original FFL , STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME ! ||| 0
EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS ! ||| 0
DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME ! ||| 0
Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB . ||| 0
Final Comments : I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip ( I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room ) and every time I tried to stomach through this game , I kept running back to Mario Golf . ||| 0
Please , if you want a good game , get anything but this . ||| 0
