Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played . ||| 1
It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft , and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either . ||| 1
It is the most original RTS game out there , as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes , special characters each of the races have . ||| 1
Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters , but that is a stupid statement . ||| 1
They are very powerful , but everyone has 3 of them , and they balance each other , being the same costs/availability . ||| 1
They each have their roles , and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game . ||| 1
All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match , and like chess takes many hours to master , so do n't buy this game if you are short on time . ||| 1
The game play is incredible for two reasons . ||| 1
The first is the Artificial Intelligence , which is amazing . ||| 1
Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games , that AI is weak . ||| 1
But the AI that controls your troops in battle , responds to your commands , etc . ||| 1
is probably the best I have ever seen . ||| 1
The ability to put spells on auto-cast ( and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them ) is amazing . ||| 1
The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled . ||| 1
You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes ( you usually have 2 at a time , which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard , but not so much as too make it frustrating . ||| 1
It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much , but this game finds a happy median . ||| 1
The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races . ||| 1
Some people complain that other games have more . ||| 1
But in those other games , they are usually all too similar , they are just the same groups and have mostly the same stuff , but some of their stuff is stronger than other factions and some weaker ( maybe their air attack is strong but their troops weak ) . ||| 1
This usually makes only one or two factions dominant , as one aspect tends to be overpowering . ||| 1
No such thing in WarCraft 3 . ||| 1
Granted , each faction has similarities . ||| 1
But the differences are much greater , and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally . ||| 1
Any race can truly beat any race . ||| 1
The graphics are sweet . ||| 1
Even on medium , which I have them on , they look excellent . ||| 1
The simple fact of RTS games is that graphics are n't that important anyway . ||| 1
True , you like to be able to distinguish your units , but for the most part it 's kind of like chess , who cares what they look like ; you only care what they do . ||| 1
But do n't get me wrong , the graphics on this game are incredible , I 've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive . ||| 1
It just is n't a big deal to me in an RTS . ||| 1
