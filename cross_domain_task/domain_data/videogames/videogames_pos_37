Edios 's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular , and one of this year 's best games . ||| 1
Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful . ||| 1
From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself , everything is awsome . ||| 1
Attention to detail is astonishing , from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it , to the smoke from her guns , everything will leave you breathless . ||| 1
My only complaint is that lower end PCs can not run next-gen graphics , therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game 's background music , although infrequent , appears just at the right time . ||| 1
The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you 're actually in the game . ||| 1
And even the voice acting is well done , with the occasional joke now and then . ||| 1
Good job Edios ! ||| 1
Gameplay - 10/10 If you 've played a previous Tomb Raider game , then the outcome is predictable : jumping around , shooting bad guys , and the occasional puzzle and boss fight . ||| 1
It 's the execution that makes this game shine . ||| 1
No stat-building , no crappy jumps , and NO camera issues . ||| 1
Jumping will soon become natural , with the probability of barely making the ledge , requiring you to quickly save Lara via the action button . ||| 1
Shimmying , rolling , and swinging will soon become second nature ( or else ! ||| 1
) . ||| 1
Gun combat also had a massive overhaul , requiring more strategy when engaging in combat . ||| 1
Enemies wo n't dodge attacks , but are still a big threat . ||| 1
Dodging , rolling , and new slo-mo combat will aid you greatly . ||| 1
Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out , but execution can be tricky . ||| 1
Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways , allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style . ||| 1
Overall , brilliant execution . ||| 1
Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky , a 10 $ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up . ||| 1
Story - 8.5/10 As before , you have to raid tombs ( hence the name ) , gaining the artifact inside . ||| 1
What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara 's past into the mix , allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear . ||| 1
Not spectacular , but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short , but the hidden artifacts and unlockables ( and a time trial mode ) , allows for many a redo . ||| 1
Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics , gameplay , and audio will blow you away . ||| 1
The Bad-Low end PCs ca n't run next-gen graphics ; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell ? ||| 1
! -Early in the game , you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette . ||| 1
Weird . ||| 1
Buy or Rent-Buy . ||| 1
You 'll want to keep this one for ages ! ||| 1
