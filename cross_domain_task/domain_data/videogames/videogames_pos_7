I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs . ||| 1
Got to run around a wartorn planet , a Tau spaceship , an Imperial spaceship ... ||| 1
Wonder what 's next ? ||| 1
There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game , so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt ... ||| 1
However , I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it 's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies ; they practically run around trying to dodge you . ||| 1
The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position . ||| 1
If you can live with that , you WILL enjoy this game ! ||| 1
