`` Mixed reactions '' Kingdom Hearts ... my second favourite PS2 game ... ||| 1
KH : Chain of Memories ... ||| 1
a good game , but not what i expected ... ||| 1
Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game . ||| 1
The story continues from Kingdom Hearts . ||| 1
Sora , Donald and Goofy just found Pluto running with a letter . ||| 1
The intro has PS2 graphics ! ||| 1
They find a man in a black cloak who leads him to Castle Oblivian . ||| 1
He gets cards that takes him to different worlds . ||| 1
The story is really the same as KH , but they replace `` heart '' with memory . ||| 1
Do you remember in KH , Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland accused her because she thought Alice Attempted to steal her heart ? ||| 1
In this Queen think the tried to steal her memory . ||| 1
Other than that they introduce new characters . ||| 1
And when you finish the game you unlock a new mode , which lets you play as Riku , with a different story , about Riku 's darkness . ||| 1
Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird ! ||| 1
! ||| 1
But to get into a battle you see heartles walk around if they touch you you enter the battle , you can hit them with your Keyblade to stun the enemies when you enter ( Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga ? ||| 1
) . ||| 1
Well in-battle heartles surround you and you battle , you have cards depending on your attack . ||| 1
Each card has a number depending you strong it is . ||| 1
When you opponents attack you see wat card they use , and then you can use your card , if your card 's number is higher you can break the opponents card , a 0 breaks anything but could be as easily broken by something higher . ||| 1
You can 3 cards so you use them at once or use a special attack ( so if you stock 3 keyblades , Sora does his 3 hit combo . ||| 1
If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga . ||| 1
Graphics Graphics are pretty good . ||| 1
In KH do you know , when you start , the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic , and the same for the end ? ||| 1
IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH , same as the end . ||| 1
The normal graphics are good too . ||| 1
Sound Sound ... ||| 1
I LOVE THE KH MUSIC ! ||| 1
This is good too ! ||| 1
! ||| 1
They do Simple & Clean at the end ! ||| 1
The sound is terrific . ||| 1
Playtime This game could last ... ||| 1
after you finish Sora 's mode you get Riku 's mode . ||| 1
Score 8.9 ||| 1
