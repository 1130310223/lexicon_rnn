Just finished playing Batman : Arkham Asylum and it occurs to me that the true single player shooter/RPG is dead , long live the shooter/RPG . ||| 0
I say this because I finished B : AA in a little over a day . ||| 0
Remember when Zelda or Silent Hill or Final Fantasy or Metal Gear provided weeks of immersive escapist delight ? ||| 0
Now , these kinds of single player experiences have basically been given lip service and effectively jettisoned in exchange for gratuitous ( albeit cool ) super-graphics , boring and useless cut scenes ( I want to play I do n't want to watch ) and worst of all expanded on-line circle jerkage . ||| 0
Really , with an environment like Silent Hill to suck you in and scare the crap out of you for three solid , befuddling weeks , do I really care if I can enter an online world where I 'm competing against some angst-ridden , suicidal , pimply faced , vapid , goth pre-adolescent pre-teen with mommy/daddy issues ? ||| 0
Oh , and not just like one of them , but , like , dude , like hundreds , like yo ? ||| 0
Please , bring back the day where an old fart like me can fire up the X-Box or the Playstation ( not the Wii , give me a break ) , and look forward to weeks and weeks of kick butt shooter/RPG action and adventure and frights and delights . ||| 0
You can take your on-line mosh pits and shove them . ||| 0
Somebody , please , bring back a true single player gaming experience ! ||| 0
