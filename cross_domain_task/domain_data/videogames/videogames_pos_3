It surprises me how this game is underrated ! ||| 1
I was really surprised the first time I played it . ||| 1
Sadly , this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64 . ||| 1
They took the original C64 game they added more bosses , characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula . ||| 1
But does it really matter ... ? ||| 1
No , since it 's almost a brand-new game , they put so much new features that if you did n't like the old one , you 're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it . ||| 1
Even if this game is so underrated , even if so many people think this game is not really good , I 'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play ! ||| 1
Gameplay- You 'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter ! ||| 1
You can easily master your character after a while , so do n't worry about the controls . ||| 1
The camera is also easy to master : you press the button it 's assigned to and it will come right behind you . ||| 1
As for the game difficulty , it 's not a really hard game , but it 's no piece of cake ! ||| 1
Like in most adventure games , there are enigmas , action and fighting . ||| 1
Some enigmas are quite hard to figure out , but the game is more based on action and fighting . ||| 1
You can get really frustrated , when it 's the Xth time you fail killing X boss , or the Xth time you 're trying to jump at the very same place , but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game . ||| 1
If you are a person who get scared really easily , you might find it a little scary ... I did ! ||| 1
Score : 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen : Cornell , a strong man-beast , ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula . ||| 1
Pretty good story , and if it seems simple , do n't worry ; you will soon get into it . ||| 1
But it does n't end here ! ||| 1
Seven years after Cornell 's quest , three warriors are also following his path , as the darkness arises again . ||| 1
Henry , a boy whom Cornell had saved , Reinhardt , a descendant of the Belmont bloodline , and Carrie , a girl with magical powers , also venture into Castlevania and each have their own story . ||| 1
In addition to Count Dracula , Cornell , Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game , so this is no boring story ! ||| 1
Score : 10/10 Graphics - The graphics are n't the best I 've ever seen , but they 're still quite good looking , and they are by far better than average graphics . ||| 1
Some animations are quite bad , like people standing up or rolling out of the way , but the overall looks very good . ||| 1
Castlevania really looks like an old castle , and your characters are really well-designed . ||| 1
The places never look the same , which is a good point . ||| 1
The lightning effects are particularly good , and so does the fog . ||| 1
During night time , you can see the red moon up there in the sky , which looks almost real . ||| 1
The enemies look so real , you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you : ) Score : 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying ( sometimes ) , it 's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in . ||| 1
It really makes you ''get into the game '' . ||| 1
There is all kind of music , and depending in which kind of place you are , you can get calm music or rock-like music . ||| 1
You will have all your time to enjoy it , as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game . ||| 1
This makes the game even scarier . ||| 1
As for the sounds , they are almost perfect . ||| 1
The lightning sounds really good , and you can hear your character walking , attacking , getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning , fighting , growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die ( especially the vampires ' death , it sounds so cool ! ||| 1
) . ||| 1
Score : 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with : each has to take a different path to complete their tasks , so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player . ||| 1
However , once you 've done a stage with one of the character , you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later : there are only two stages that are unique to one player : the others are going to have to be completed two , three or even four times , which makes the replay value not really good . ||| 1
Unless you 're a huge Castlevania fan , you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again , so you might not want to play it again . ||| 1
It depends on how you like the game , but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored . ||| 1
Score : 8.5/10 Overall score : 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it , find it , buy it ! ||| 1
! ||| 1
This game is hard to find , so you will have a hard time finding it . ||| 1
You 're really going to love it , do n't think his game is bad , 'cause it 's good and you 're going to enjoy it . ||| 1
So if you manage to get your hands on it : you just got one of the greatest game ever ! ||| 1
