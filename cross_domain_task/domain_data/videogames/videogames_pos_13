`` Almost , but not quite '' So here 's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360 . ||| 1
I enjoyed this game . ||| 1
I 'll admit the plotline sucked , the guns feel weak , and the worlds kind of boring . ||| 1
Pros : Fun game play . ||| 1
You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets , and killing or destroying anything near you . ||| 1
Big selection of military vehicles . ||| 1
Good graphics . ||| 1
However , towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck . ||| 1
The cities are all dark ; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns , and cannons , ect . ||| 1
However , at this point in the game , the draw distances become smaller , and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2 . ||| 1
However , in sunny VZ , the game looks nice . ||| 1
Also , the explosions look great . ||| 1
Airstrikes are great , fun , and you 'll always have them . ||| 1
It 's fun to get a sports car , or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle . ||| 1
Cons : Guns are weak and inaccurate . ||| 1
You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4 . ||| 1
Racing missions are just annoying . ||| 1
I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again . ||| 1
Sometimes there are cheap deaths . ||| 1
For example , 30 guys with RPG 's will shoot at you all at once . ||| 1
Maps to big . ||| 1
There 's just nothing to do at a lot of the places . ||| 1
However , Mercs 2 was fun , and I did enjoy it . ||| 1
If you can get it for less than 30 bucks , I 'll say it 's worth it . ||| 1
