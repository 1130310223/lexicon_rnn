I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it . ||| 0
I doubt the producers have ever been to it . ||| 0
And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game ? ||| 0
It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need . ||| 0
Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable . ||| 0
GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics , but this sadly will remind you of the chunky , low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64 . ||| 0
As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube ( but then I played Star Fox Adventures ) . ||| 0
Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien , you do n't cuddle him , you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so ( you would expect it to subtract points would n't you ? ) ||| 0
and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles . ||| 0
I also went right through a bench once . ||| 0
And I also find myself running through a lot of people . ||| 0
MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game , it does not change . ||| 0
It is impossible to survive the music , even though there is very little of it , when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute . ||| 0
It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay . ||| 0
GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games ! ||| 0
The gameplay is not worthy of anything . ||| 0
There is no clear entry to a game ( except when the person says : '' Here it is , have fun ! ||| 0
'' ) . ||| 0
And you earn points for things that you do n't even see . ||| 0
They tried to make a good item system , but they unfortunately failed , and quite miserably may I add ? ||| 0
The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then , it may have received a six or even a seven , but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4 . ||| 0
OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique , but the gameplay , graphics , music and sound effects ruin it . ||| 0
It seems that the uniqueness and potential were , unfortunately , not enought to save the game . ||| 0
It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated , angry or upset about not being able to enter the games . ||| 0
RENT OR BUY ? ||| 0
Neither , I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps . ||| 0
If you want good rides , go to Universal Studios , do not buy this , it just does not cut it . ||| 0
If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6 , not this . ||| 0
So on a final note do n't buy this , it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still could n't convince me that it was a good game . ||| 0
Clear instructions , realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material , but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately wo n't impress . ||| 0
