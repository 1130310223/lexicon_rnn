`` Innovative '' I played GC endlessly when it came out . ||| 1
Very addictive ! ||| 1
There is a steep learning curve in this game , which can only partly be compensated by starting off with weak enemies . ||| 1
When you play against weak foes , you will not really be `` tested . '' ||| 1
You will just get an easier game . ||| 1
Also , your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off , so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy . ||| 1
Just when you think you got it figured out , you will get hit upside the head , or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you . ||| 1
If you graduate to intelligent enemies , the game is `` very challenging , '' aka `` painful . '' ||| 1
You may win one out of ten tries . ||| 1
That can be discouraging ; when you seem to be getting off to a good start , only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything ; and no help from your supposed allies . ||| 1
The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex , that it can actually make you feel stupid , which is probably not good for the gaming masses . ||| 1
Considering the fragile male ego , I would think that most guys want to feel smarter than the game-in-the-box , and would simply give up on this game . ||| 1
Girls are welcome to try of course ! ||| 1
True strategy aficionados ( and a few sado-masochists ) will take this routine humiliation as a challenge and rack their brains to figure out a better way to play , but ultimately a player 's choices are limited -- and sometimes you are simply doomed . ||| 1
One thing I can say for sure : If you get a bad starting location , you will never overcome it , no matter how hard you try . ||| 1
If you get bad position , just START OVER . ||| 1
In fact , let me file that one complaint : starting location in the galaxy ( which seems fairly randomized ) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome . ||| 1
EARLY GAME STRATEGY TIPS Best starting politics is either pacifist or populist . ||| 1
Speed is a good primary enhancement , plus diplomacy and influence . ||| 1
Speed is very useful at the beginning , whereas influence and diplomacy have strong effects later on . ||| 1
You need to start in a location which is relatively unoccupied by potential enemies , and land grab like crazy . ||| 1
This means 100 % or 66 % military spending ( for colony ships ) and zero social spending for 10 or 20 turns . ||| 1
Try to build a couple more survey ships for a quick boost to your stats and possible early attack capability . ||| 1
If you have a nearby competitor , use your survey ships ( if they procure attack capability , a matter of luck ) to wipe out colony ships and other survey ships to secure your sector of the galaxy . ||| 1
Early wars are soon forgotten and do not affect your alignment . ||| 1
Usually the entire galaxy gets occupied quickly , but sometimes there will be a `` backwater '' of stars which is too far from all comers for direct colonization . ||| 1
The secret is to build a space station ( or a chain of them ) to bridge the gap and get your colonists over there . ||| 1
That backwater is likely the safest location in the game . ||| 1
Once established , you have to adapt your strategy depending on your relative location and alignment . ||| 1
GC is an amazingly difficult game ! ||| 1
I am looking forward to trying out GC2 , but from the reviews , it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships . ||| 1
I do n't think I want to pay $ 40 for that `` privilege . '' ||| 1
