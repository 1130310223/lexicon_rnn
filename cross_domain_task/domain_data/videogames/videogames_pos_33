If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs , then Baldur 's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs . ||| 1
This is simply one of the best series of games ever made , and any RPG fan simply can not afford to not play it ( and since the whole series is available for a tenner , you do n't exactly have an excuse not to do so ! ) ||| 1
Pros : -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds . ||| 1
I have n't seen a bargain like that for a while . ||| 1
-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur 's Gate 1 , and then after completing the first game , import them into Baldur 's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga . ||| 1
-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss , with an epic storyline to match . ||| 1
-Although the storyline does follow a set path , there are no restrictions in party members . ||| 1
Does your childhood friend Imoen annoy the hell out of you ? ||| 1
Then dump her in the inn ( or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil ) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead ! ||| 1
-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end . ||| 1
-Choose your character 's allignment ( from 'goody-goody two shoes ' to 'completely neutral ' to 'murderous lunatic ' . ||| 1
-Unlike the original releases , every part of the series is just 1 DVD , which creates a lot less hassle . ||| 1
Cons : -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still ca n't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions . ||| 1
For this reason I 'd put off installing the expansions until you 're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content ( basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap ) . ||| 1
-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice , the good and evil aspect is n't exactly balanced . ||| 1
Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option ( and sometimes there is n't a clear-cut evil option available at all ) . ||| 1
-Since Baldur 's Gate 2 is n't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game , if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again ( and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably did n't ) . ||| 1
This ca n't really be helped though , since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur 's Gate 1 ! ||| 1
But these are n't REALLY cons , just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better ' . ||| 1
RPG fan or no , you have no excuse not to play this incredible series . ||| 1
