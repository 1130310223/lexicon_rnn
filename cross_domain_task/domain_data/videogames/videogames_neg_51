My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game ... .. ||| 0
until he finished it after 3 days . ||| 0
He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled . ||| 0
He could n't understand why there were no more levels to play . ||| 0
I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming . ||| 0
`` I already played this story . ||| 0
I want more Diego ! '' ||| 0
My advice is to not buy this game for your children . ||| 0
Especially not any over 3 years old . ||| 0
It was a total waste of my money . ||| 0
If I could return it and get a refund I would . ||| 0
And I would get a game that 's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days . ||| 0
