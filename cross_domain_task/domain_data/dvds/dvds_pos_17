Vengeance has its price . ||| 1
The revenge Western has been around for quite some time as long as revenge has been around I suppose ( which may be redundant ) and the latest of this sub-genre owes quite a bit to John Ford 's `` The Searchers '' and a kissing cousin to the Clint Eastwood revenge oater `` The Outlaw Josey Wales ' . ||| 1
In its latest incarnation , the story begins in the wintry confines of the Ruby Mountains circa 1868 , and Gideon ( a nearly unrecognizable Brosnan as far away from being The Artist Formerly Known As Bond here ) is being pursued by a relentless tracker in the form of a taciturn man named Carver ( low-key Neeson speaking volumes in his determined yet steely silent eyes ) , hell-bent on catching his fugitive , in tow with several hired guns to get the job done , by any means necessary . ||| 1
Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape , falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity , the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver 's troupe are two-behind . ||| 1
The reason for Carver 's intent is not revealed until the final act ( which is the weaker part of the film ) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who do n't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure . ||| 1
Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness , sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair , a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run . ||| 1
Proving it takes two-to-tango , Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent : revenge at any price . ||| 1
There are a few tweaks to the genre 's stock characters : young gun bank robbers ; a railroad crew of hostile Irishmen and victimized Chinese slave labor ; wise Indian proclaiming nuggets of choice phrasings ; a snake-oil sales ( wo ) man ( Huston at her slyest ) who may-or- may-not-be-a-desert-mirage ; and the off-beat missionaries on pilgrimage . ||| 1
But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut ( a TV vet of such shows as `` Numb3rs '' & `` CSI : NY '' ) who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations ( a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat ; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV ) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs ( the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid , no-man 's land salt flats ) to their advantage . ||| 1
Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody , graphic sequences , it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western , the best since `` Unforgiven '' and last year 's `` The Proposition '' . ||| 1
