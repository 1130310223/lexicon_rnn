The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first . ||| 0
Until I saw the movie ! ||| 0
There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film . ||| 0
The first fifteen minutes , and the final ten minutes . ||| 0
Everything in between is a bunch of garbage . ||| 0
The saying goes ( in this movie ) , whenever a child looses his last baby-tooth , the evil Tooth-Fairy will come for you ( or something to that effect ) . ||| 0
But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after . ||| 0
I mean , are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth ? ||| 0
People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day , but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy has n't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world . ||| 0
For some reason she is obsessed with only these two . ||| 0
The little kid , who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning , is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult . ||| 0
Personally , I do n't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13 . ||| 0
What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore ? ||| 0
I 've seen more blood from a paper-cut than in PG horrors . ||| 0
PG only works for horror films that have high-profile stars and Oscar dreams . ||| 0
Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster . ||| 0
It only sounded like a good idea , but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache . ||| 0
Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies , Darkness Falls would have fit right in . ||| 0
I probably would 've accepted it , or had more respect for it , and given it a much higher rating . ||| 0
It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie . ||| 0
People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem 's Lot , Satan 's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror . ||| 0
But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see , most have trashed it . ||| 0
You do n't expect the same from Television as you would from a major theatrical release . ||| 0
You just do n't rate them on the same level . ||| 0
You do n't rate a childs finger-painting alongside great masterpieces ... .you rate it alongside the finger-paintings of other children . ||| 0
I rate television movies ( which I rarely watch ) differently than I would a major motion picture . ||| 0
I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie . ||| 0
But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI , USA or an ABC movie of the week . ||| 0
As a theatrical movie , I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere . ||| 0
A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it . ||| 0
Had it been a made-for-TV movie , I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was ( again ) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere . ||| 0
A good idea done right by television standards , and well worth watching for free . ||| 0
Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein 's : Goosebumps episode . ||| 0
And if you rate it along those lines , then it would have been good , and very much talked about . ||| 0
I gave this film a 2/10 . ||| 0
A point for the only two good scenes in this film . ||| 0
The beginning and the end . ||| 0
But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child 's pillow . ||| 0
