Tongue-thru-cheek T & A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly has n't a clever thought in its ripped out skull : a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill , only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash . ||| 0
