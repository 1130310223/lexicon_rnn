( Dir : Kasi Lemmons ) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility . ||| 1
Perhaps this , one of his best roles to date , will change perspectives overall . ||| 1
Cheadle plays ex-con Petey Greene , a street-smart smoothie , attempting to go legit by looking up a fellow prisoner 's brother , Dewey Hughes ( Ejiofor also giving an excellent turn ) , an uptight Washington , DC radio programming manager on the rise who is at a crossroads himself in the hope for bigger and brighter things in a broadcasting career he aspires to . ||| 1
When Petey arrives , all hell breaks loose , with genuine concern expressed by Dewey 's boss EG Sonderling ( Sheen ) who has given him the daunting task of making the station a more viable form of entertainment for its dwindling listening in audience . ||| 1
Dewey reluctantly sees inspiration in the foul-mouthed Greene and recruits him only after a series of arguments , insults and a one-up-manship in a game of pool reducing Greene to his basics : a brother in need of a job . ||| 1
After a near disastrous opening show , Greene is given one more shot by a scheming Dewey ( who locks out all the staff as Greene goes into his fast-talking no bs mode ) with the gambit paying off to callers ringing the phones off the hook . ||| 1
In the interim , Dewey begins booking Greene on stand-up comic networking him into a local TV showcasing the controversial DJ and eventually to the top : a spot on `` The Tonight Show '' in NYC . ||| 1
Director Lemmons deftly balances the prickly comedy with the genuine drama best depicted in the day Martin Luther King , Jr is assassinated and having Petey shine in his finest hours telling it like it is and uniting the city from the firestorms and rioting in the streets . ||| 1
She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey 's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama . ||| 1
Overall the acting is solid and on the money , again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy . ||| 1
The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late , great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life ( Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s ) . ||| 1
The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable . ||| 1
