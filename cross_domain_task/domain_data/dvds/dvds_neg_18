Why did I buy this one ? ||| 0
I keep asking myself that . ||| 0
Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos . ||| 0
I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful ... and now this . ||| 0
I have been bellydancing and performing with it for a few years , and I knew better-but I had to buy it . ||| 0
Save your money and do n't . ||| 0
First of all-you ca n't teach a belly dance video if you ca n't belly dance yourself . ||| 0
The first thing I noticed was that Kathy ca n't keep a rhythm and you can not properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video . ||| 0
The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one . ||| 0
I think since Ansuya ( Of Bellydance Superstars ) was in the background , and was the one who taught Kathy the dance moves-that Ansuya should have been the main instructor here , maybe with Kathy Smith `` assisting her '' , rather than Kathy leading the video . ||| 0
Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment ( lifting the chest up , to one side , down , then to the other side ) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there . ||| 0
So , she was teaching a `` chest circle '' but she was not doing one . ||| 0
She was actually doing a `` chest lift , chest slide , chest drop , chest slide '' because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly . ||| 0
She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward , back , back , back ... she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward , back , same , same . ||| 0
I understand that she is a beginner , and that she is not a belly dancer . ||| 0
This is my point . ||| 0
Kathy does n't need to be a `` pro '' to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class . ||| 0
Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video . ||| 0
Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time . ||| 0
Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you ca n't take lessons for one month , and then put out a video . ||| 0
This was not even the worst part of the video , in my opinion . ||| 0
You can not belly dance in your `` perky step aerobics instructor '' persona . ||| 0
I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out `` OOOOOooooowwww ! '' ||| 0
This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years , but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky . ||| 0
( although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this ) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance , however . ||| 0
You would n't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number , and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect . ||| 0
I found Kathy 's overall attitude about belly dance appalling . ||| 0
Her `` woo-hoo ! '' ||| 0
-ing and shouting ... and yelling `` Yeah ! '' ||| 0
`` OOOOoow ! '' ||| 0
during the dance moves . ||| 0
It really felt to me like Kathy was in `` aerobics class '' persona , just wearing a fancy costume . ||| 0
During the fast portion of the workout , it is almost as if Kathy ca n't hear the music . ||| 0
She has no natural rhythm , and frequently gets off beat with the music . ||| 0
What I found funny about this , is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point , and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing . ||| 0
The costumes and sets were gorgeous ... but a her whooping wolf calls , bad dancing , and total lack of knowledge of belly dance in general ca n't be covered up with `` pretties '' . ||| 0
There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not . ||| 0
It only takes a minute to do this ... and it is important to properly execute some of the moves . ||| 0
Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya , I would venture to say that Kathy does n't know a doumbek from a zil ... or a beledi from a karshlima . ||| 0
Trust me ... you want someone who DOES . ||| 0
To sum it up ... Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks . ||| 0
The only problem is that belly dance is an actual art form and takes a lot of training to execute . ||| 0
She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video . ||| 0
Sheesh . ||| 0
Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this ... because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one . ||| 0
I understand completely that this is marketed as an `` exercise '' video , and is not a professional dance instructional . ||| 0
However , most belly dance exercise videos ( such as those from Suhaila , Rania , Veena & Neena , etc . ) ||| 0
are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to `` make a video '' on it , but has no experience at all . ||| 0
To teach Middle Eastern dance in any form-a real dance video , or an exercise video-you should know how to do it yourself . ||| 0
