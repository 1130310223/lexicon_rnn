This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen , and anyone that has read the books will agree with me ! ||| 0
If you have seen the movie I suggest you do n't read the book because you will be so confused on what is happening . ||| 0
This movie skipped 3 whole city 's and many , many main characters that were important to the story line . ||| 0
They also skipped many important events like Eragon 's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head . ||| 0
He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves . ||| 0
Also , did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie ? ||| 0
No ? ||| 0
Did n't think so ! ||| 0
Hothgar was the dwarf king and Orik was Eragons best friend in the book . ||| 0
Oh , and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding ( and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure ) Oh yeah , back to the smoke monster , it was never in the book ! ||| 0
Durza was fighting Eragon under the star sapphire ( that they also did n't mention ) and then Ayra broke it with magic because she was helping Saphira with her broken armor and THAT 'S when Saphira first used fire . ||| 0
Eragon then used Zar'roc ( who 's gem should have been a ruby not a sapphire because Morzans dragon was red ) to kill Durza . ||| 0
Then there is the Razac ! ||| 0
There were only two in the book ! ||| 0
The reason Brom should have died is because they were chasing the Razac because Eragon wanted revenge on them killing Garrow ( his uncle ) . ||| 0
He also never learned sword fighting from Ro'ran and the movie never showed him fighting with Brom . ||| 0
Also , would it have killed them to put in Katrina , Ro'rans girlfriend that gets kidnapped in Eldest by the ( ( ( 2 ) ) ) Razac ! ! ||| 0
! ||| 0
Then they never went to Tierm were he really met Angela ( the fortune teller ) and The Werecat Solumbun who tells him important information that they need to use in the third book . ||| 0
They also never met Jeod in Tierm who they need to help them find the Razac that they were chasing not running away from them . ||| 0
