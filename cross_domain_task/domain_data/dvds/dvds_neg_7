More like a simmering potboiler : 1995 's crackling neo-noir sleeper `` The Usual Suspects '' was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was . ||| 0
The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color ( and yes the pun is meant to be offensive ) . ||| 0
Set in the twilight hours in a no-names urbane city an ambitious DA named Ford Cole ( Liotta , who is also a producer on this dreadful film ) who is summoned to the police station when one of his younger protges ( and current lover ) , Nora Timmer ( mannequin Blalock ) has been involved in a lethal shooting after her claims of being raped by her assailant , Isaac Duperde . ||| 0
Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of `` Law & Order '' : Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant , may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta . ||| 0
Enter Luther Pinks ( Cool J ) , who has some info on Timmer confirming she is not on the level and his identity is also in question ( as is his purple prose involving his olfactory senses with laughable line readings ) . ||| 0
The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it 's cribbing of the final act of `` Suspects '' for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart , knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second ' glance and pause in his tracks . ||| 0
Although Blalock is a real hottie , the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white ' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film 's scribe . ||| 0
The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling . ||| 0
It does n't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year . ||| 0
That 's never a good sign and another is shamefully stealing from a real classic . ||| 0
