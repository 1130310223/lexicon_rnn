If you thought PULSE was bad , OOOH just you wait ! ||| 0
They made a sequel ! ||| 0
If you did happen to see these both , you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one , however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst . ||| 0
If acting was a draw- back , then understanding what they where talking about was another story . ||| 0
It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen , where the backdrop ... ||| 0
well looked as fake as it was ... . ||| 0
While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another , the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion . ||| 0
Even though I did n't LIKE the first movie , this one just sets another bar ! ||| 0
To add , the plot is TERRIBLE , and questionable . ||| 0
And what 's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt ' ? ||| 0
It was obnoxious and corny , and given the circumstances I would n't appreciate it ... ||| 0
And the naked girl ... . ||| 0
obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market , and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge . ||| 0
Seriously , do n't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did . ||| 0
