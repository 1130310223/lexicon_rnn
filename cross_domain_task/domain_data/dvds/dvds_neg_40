I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek ( over 30 miles ) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters ( 400 or so ) nationally . ||| 0
How sad..because there are three theaters within 13 miles that could be playing it but are not . ||| 0
Warner Bros. keep doing this and good & faithful patrons will quit giving you their business . ||| 0
We deserve better than this . ||| 0
Theater operators say its the distributors fault and if that is true then I say boycott and just simply wait till these few good movies are out in video . ||| 0
We in the outlying areas seem to be treated as of lesser importance and are burdened with excessive trips just to see a select movie . ||| 0
Recently some stars even raised their ire over distributors failings as to getting a few select films out to the public . ||| 0
