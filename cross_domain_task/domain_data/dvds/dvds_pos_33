BLADE RUNNER ( DIRECTOR 'S CUT ) ( 1982 ) **** Harrison Ford , Rutger Hauer , Sean Young , Edward James Olmos , Brion James , William Sanderson , Daryl Hannah , Joanna Cassidy , M. Emmett Walsh , Joe Turkel . ||| 1
Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour `` blade runner '' Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty ( appropriately named and Hauer 's best performance of his career ) out to terminate his maker . ||| 1
Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design . ||| 1
Based on Philip K. Dick 's cult genre novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ' . ||| 1
This edition dismisses the droning narration ( incidentally Ford did this on purpose when the studio forced director Ridley Scott to include it for clarity in protest but ironically appropriate for his Philip Marlowesque character ) and restore its original ending . ||| 1
Visionary film-making at its best . ||| 1
My favorite lines : James as Leon to Ford 's Deckard in a compromising position : 'Wake up . ||| 1
Time to die . ' ||| 1
And Hauer 's bemused Batty to a fleeing Deckard 'Where 're you going ? ' ||| 1
during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building , as well as his improvised `` like tears in rain '' speech which always gets me . ||| 1
