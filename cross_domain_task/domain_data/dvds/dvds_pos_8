THE ICE HARVEST ( 2005 ) *** John Cusack , Billy Bob Thornton , Connie Nielsen , Oliver Platt , Randy Quaid , Mike Starr . ||| 1
Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria , Billy Bob Thrornton ( both co-starred in 1999 's `` Pushing Tin '' a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other 's throats ) and together they make a fine comic duo . ||| 1
The post noir plot has to do with Kansas City 'mob lawyer ' Charlie Arglist ( Cusack ) and his acquaintance Vic Cavanaugh ( Thornton ) ripping off one of Charlie 's clients , Bill Guerrard ( Quaid ) , by skimming some $ 2M in change and heading for warmer climes then the titular weather condition that serves as a character in itself in causing things to get slippery in their grand scheme of the high life on a chilly Christmas Eve in Wichita Falls . ||| 1
Charlie does n't have much luck : his wife has left him for his best friend Pete van Heuten ( scene stealer Platt ) who keeps turning up like a bad ( drunken ) penny throughout the festive evening while Charlie 's doubts of the perfect crime getting gummed up as he fears his ( rightful ) paranoia that Bill will catch wind of their theft and finds solid evidence that he is right in the form of Bill 's henchman Roy ( Starr ) who keeps showing up moments after Charlie has arrived at say a strip club bar he frequents . ||| 1
To add fuel to the conflagration brewing is Renata ( Nielsen channeling Veronica Lake replete with that icon 's peekabo 'do ) , the sexily mysterious owner of the nudie bar Charlie keeps seeking refuge in and has the not-so-original idea of running away with the femme fatale in the process . ||| 1
What makes all this funny is Cusack 's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality . ||| 1
His timing is right on the money and Thornton 's prickly , misanthropic ( and homicidal ) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations . ||| 1
Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way ( I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so ) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips ' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed . ||| 1
Cinematographer Alar Kivilo 's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters ' plight . ||| 1
For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem . ||| 1
