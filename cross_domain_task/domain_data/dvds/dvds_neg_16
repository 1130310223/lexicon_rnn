When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is , 'Well , at least a lot of stuntmen got work ' , there is something wrong with the film . ||| 0
In this film , there are too many problems to list . ||| 0
However , here are a few . ||| 0
Where was the writer ? ||| 0
Obviously , the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on . ||| 0
The story was weak and beaten to death . ||| 0
Disgruntled foreigner gets mad and wants to kill everybody and cause worldwide panic . ||| 0
Wow . ||| 0
What a concept . ||| 0
Actually , if done properly , it can be a good concept . ||| 0
There were only a few things running against it being truly good . ||| 0
They are Vin Diesel , the Director , the production crew and the continuity supervisor . ||| 0
Unfortunately , all of these were involved in this film . ||| 0
The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane . ||| 0
From a GTO that can drive through Prague at 80 MPH ( in the city ) , but ca n't go that fast in straight-aways to a deadly toxin that is rendered impotent by water . ||| 0
Water ? ||| 0
Yes . ||| 0
Water . ||| 0
I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that do n't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water . ||| 0
Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film ? ||| 0
Then there is Vin Diesel . ||| 0
I can guarantee you , he was a much better bouncer than he ever will be an actor . ||| 0
Does he have only one tone to his voice ? ||| 0
It 's okay for a short film or small part in a film , but a whole feature ? ||| 0
It 's like listening to Schwarzenegger , but he can do some acting . ||| 0
A body and a voice do not an actor make . ||| 0
Do you know who Jeff Chandler is ? ||| 0
Exactly ! ||| 0
Stay away from this film like the plague . ||| 0
It 's just bad . ||| 0
The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy . ||| 0
If all spies looked like her and moved like her , there would be chaos in the world . ||| 0
Unfortunately , it is not worth the $ 9.00 to go see her only . ||| 0
It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store . ||| 0
Then , get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain ' . ||| 0
Hey , $ 0.50 out of your pocket is better than $ 9.00 . ||| 0
I 'd rather watch Howard the Duck again . ||| 0
I 'm going to go get a mint . ||| 0
Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour . ||| 0
