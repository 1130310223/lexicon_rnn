Tart Satire of TV ; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan 's latest satire , `` THE TV SET '' , is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality ' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence , the true pillars of its foundation , the scripted format is on the wane . ||| 1
Never before has a sharp-edged black comedy been needed to poke at the underbelly of the medium than now . ||| 1
The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded , hastily dispatched `` Freaks & Geeks , that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created . ||| 1
To wit : veteran scribe Mike Klein ( Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan , is a study in noble rot ) is desperately trying to get his current project `` The Wexler Chronicles '' , a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother 's suicide 's affect on him , past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network ( think CW lite ) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous , yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway ' Lenny ( Weaver , a dry riot ) , a harpy in a suit , who is not Mike 's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister ( Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business ) , a Brit late of the BBC , whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up . ||| 1
He too is hedging his bets but mostly due to his domestic dilemma of not being there for his family while juggling the powers that be with the promising sitcom-to-be . ||| 1
Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show 's lead character , Zach Harper ( newcomer Kranz , suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal ) ; an inept director ( Garson ) ; his airhead manager Alice ( Greer ) who backpedals everything thrown her way ; his pregnant wife ( Bateman making a nice return to film here ) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure ; and one lulu of a recurring , crippling back ailment . ||| 1
Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit , caustic dialogue , and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it 's a true wonder how the hell they got so far ( let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life ! ) ||| 1
Duchovny 's Mike Klein , behind a thatch of itchy/scratchy beard as a mask of indifference to what is thrown at him knowing ultimately he will have to acquiesce at basically every power play and sign his soul away to get his baby on the air ; truly soul-crushing to watch one 's lifetime dream become a living nightmare . ||| 1
While not a classic like `` The Player '' or even `` Network '' the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either ; Lenny would n't have it any other way . ||| 1
