UNDEAD ( 2005 ) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I 've ever seen nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it 's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating ( ok -- - Stealing ! ||| 0
Robert Rodriguez camera angles , `` Matrix '' type pacings and Peter Jackson 's seminal `` DeadAlive '' to name three counts of plagiarism ) far too many hybrids and quite frankly a real mess overall . ||| 0
I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness ( while plentiful ) is the least of this film 's problems . ||| 0
There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it does n't explain anything that has just transpired ( or even attempts too ! ) ||| 0
I 'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they 're behind . ||| 0
Atrocious ! ||| 0
