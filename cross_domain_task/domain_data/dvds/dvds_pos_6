IFC produced indie gem with great , subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film 's focal point : to wit , former idealized hippie Jack Slavin ( a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis ) who lives with his tween daughter Rose ( bewitched , beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle ) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother ( who left them when she was very young ) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States ' ( as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing `` I Put A Spell On You '' by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone ) . ||| 1
Sharing a very close bond the family has kept pretty much to themselves except that Jack has been seeing a woman named Kathleen ( the always welcome Catherine Keener ) on shore , and - more or less reasoning due to his heart ailment causing serious concerns spontaneously visits her with a request : for Kathleen to move in with them , including her two sons from previous marriages ( each from a different , deserted husband ) Thaddius ( Paul Drano ) a grungy , skinny 'bad boy ' and Rodney ( Ryan McDonald , suggesting a more intense with his emotions Jack Black ) , a literate introvert 'good boy ' . ||| 1
Naturally this sudden invite causes some alarm for all parties involved shaking up the ecosystem he has preserved and rattling the fragile yet rebellious Rose to no end ( on the first night alone when the taken-with-cosmetology Rodney experiments on her hair with a severe crop she pulls a shotgun on the sleeping bodies of her father 's new lover with a funny take ; no one gets hurt but things get shaken up to more stirrings down the road ) . ||| 1
Added to the mix of the Slavin drama is Jack 's relentless feud with local developer Marty Rance ( a low-key yet pitch-perfect Beau Bridges ) , a decent well-meaning man whose pre-fab Colonial style dwellings are a major disdain for Jack who feels Marty is simply all about making a cruel dollar and negating the environment in general ( which is Jack 's true passion ) . ||| 1
Written and directed by D-Day 's real-life wife Rebecca Miller ( daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur ) , the film has a leisurely paced , lovely-to-look at feel ( kudos to cinematographer Ellen Kuras - who collaborated with Miller on Personal Velocity for her beatifically lensed work including such imagery as sun dappling water , a twinkling of an electric storm in a blue-violet twilight and a dazzling full moon on a clear night ) as well as a literate outlook on her characters and their interlocking both subtle ( a painful look by Day-Lewis to his daughter 's deliberate display of losing her virginity to Thaddius ) and not-so ( a snake slithering loose under the bed during the deflowering loss of innocence etc . ) . ||| 1
But make no bones about it she is a gifted storyteller with some nice quirks ( Rose 's odd/funny/sweet attempted seduction of a highly reluctant yet respectable Rodney is one of the most amusingly warm-hearted displays in cinema of late that feels real ) . ||| 1
I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs ( Jack even notices and simply declares `` you 're getting to big for me '' ) , attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse . ||| 1
While it is well acted across the board ( Keener , again such a treat as a 'real ' woman depicted on screen ; warts and all ) including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin 's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle ( suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly ) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy ' ( she even deems Keener 's Kathleen as just that 'regular ' ) ; she is a propagation of sorts . ||| 1
There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring . ||| 1
Keep an eye on this naturally gifted young actress . ||| 1
