( Dir : Brent Hamer ) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon , believe it or not , is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s ( `` Rumble Fish '' , `` The Outsiders '' ) who can do it all , comedy ( `` There 's Something About Mary '' ) and drama ( `` Crash '' which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year ) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions . ||| 1
In this big-screen adaptation of the acclaimed writer Charles Bukowski 's rough-and- tumble works of self-emulation Dillon stars as Henry Chinaski , the loosely based on the author 's persona , a drifting writer on the skids who takes the occasional odd-job ( the title refers to a man who does many tasks ) to compensate his lifestyle of heavy drinking , chain- smoking and general carousing . ||| 1
He can barely sustain a moment 's interest at the menial labor he is offered often resulting in his immediate firing usually while imbibing at a local watering hole , indifferent to the dismay and anger of his employer . ||| 1
Chinaski is a free-spirit whose laconic demeanor is only sublimated by his desire to be a well-respected writer who continuously sends his unsolicited works to literary periodicals with the usual rejection notice ( or worse , no reply what-so-ever ) as he aimlessly pursues his next haunt . ||| 1
Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan ( Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness ) , a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out . ||| 1
The two make for a winning pair of losers , each oblivious to their falling apart and frequent dismissals of the other when in fact they are one and the same : soul mates . ||| 1
Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out ( he co-adapted with Jim Stark , one of the film 's producers ) and absurd twists to a scene ( Dillon 's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand ie explaining Jan 's shoddy car 's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on ! ) ||| 1
A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process ( Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon ) . ||| 1
Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund , Eve Cauley 's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s early '60s vibe . ||| 1
But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming , irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks ; he does his best work since changing that tune with `` Drugstore Cowboy '' and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski . ||| 1
