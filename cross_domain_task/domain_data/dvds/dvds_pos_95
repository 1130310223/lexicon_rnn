Back in Black ! ||| 1
Shane Black is back in a big way . ||| 1
If you do n't know who Shane Black is let his credits as a hot-shot screenwriter speak for themselves : `` Lethal Weapon '' , `` The Last Boy Scout '' , `` The Long Kiss Goodnight '' , `` Last Action Hero '' ( ok the last one may be the reason we have n't really heard much from him in over 7 years ! ) ||| 1
A gifted scribe of tough , snarky dialogued action flix usually produced with hyperbolic overkill by Joel Silver with huge box office boffo . ||| 1
Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical ( ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression ) and managed to get his s* % % together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly . ||| 1
If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production . ||| 1
This sure as hell ai n't . ||| 1
Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday , `` Bodies Are Where You Find Them '' , the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold `` Harry '' Lockhart ( Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking , sharp minded spite ) who winds up an unlikely actor wan na be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner 's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive ' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier ( ! ) ||| 1
and the casting agent Dabney Shaw ( funnyman scene-stealer Miller ) hires him on the spot . ||| 1
Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw 's for hire gumshoe `` Gay '' Perry ( Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor ) , a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character ' . ||| 1
But since he 's on Shaw 's permanent payroll he has no choice . ||| 1
Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane ( the luscious Monahan , who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection ) a childhood friend from Harry 's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw . ||| 1
Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant ( guess who and guess who ) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart . ||| 1
Harry 's unrequited love for Harmony is re-ignited and soon finds himself ( and Perry ) embroiled in a murder case when one of Perry 's employer 's daughters winds up killed . ||| 1
The odd couple begrudgingly decides to follow through on some seedy leads and soon wind up to their necks in dead bodies and hot water . ||| 1
Black 's sharp , skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches ' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto . ||| 1
The two leads are funny , fast-witted like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they 've both done in recent memory . ||| 1
Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin street smarts and flair to spare . ||| 1
Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell does n't hurt . ||| 1
Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action `` Johnny Gossamer '' is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott ( kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills ) . ||| 1
Fast , fleet footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings ; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it ! ||| 1
