Words can not describe how bad this movie is . ||| 0
They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster , when really he is a sympathetic monster , and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita , one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him . ||| 0
I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter . ||| 0
Yes , Swain was too old to play Lolita but why , why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old . ||| 0
Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls , by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex , which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel , she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world . ||| 0
I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do . ||| 0
Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie , meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top . ||| 0
With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he does n't try to stay true to the novel , which is a masterpiece . ||| 0
No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try . ||| 0
