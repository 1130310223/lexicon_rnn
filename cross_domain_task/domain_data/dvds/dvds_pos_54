( Dir : Michael Hoffman ) `` There 's no crying in baseball ! ||| 1
: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite ( and largely underrated ) actors . ||| 1
He has n't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy , the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson 's ( side note : I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties ! ) ||| 1
and glib , self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay . ||| 1
His latest is no exception . ||| 1
Based on a story by acclaimed author Don DeLillo ( who adapted the screenplay ) , Keaton stars as a New York bred playwright who 's latest work is to dawn on the fated October 1986 evening of the World Series where his beloved Boston Red Sox ' lifetime curse gets re-enforced by the infamous ball-between first baseman Bill Buckner 's legs . ||| 1
But I 'm getting ahead of myself . ||| 1
Nicky Rogan ( Keaton ) is facing many cross-roads : his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan 's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer ( Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn ) whose perchance for theatricality ( he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him ) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball . ||| 1
Along the way he is avoiding his family , namely his wife Lillian ( the equally gifted O'Hara ) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel ( a great Graynor ) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad 's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne ( a nubile Neuwirth ) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum . ||| 1
To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague , Elliot Litvak ( an unkempt and funny Dunne ) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia . ||| 1
Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father ( `` The Sopranos '' ' Aldredge ) figures to ditch the premiere after all ( especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain ca n't get its grasp on a key line reading ) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs . ||| 1
Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star , Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out . ||| 1
Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand . ||| 1
DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky 's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky 's family life shows a man , flawed , yet genuinely wanting to make things work . ||| 1
The same can be said of this little gem of a film . ||| 1
