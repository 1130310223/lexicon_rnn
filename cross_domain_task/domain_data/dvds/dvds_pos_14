( Dir : George Ratliff ) Sibling Rivalry : A Study in Terror What is it about the need for sibling rivalry in families ? ||| 1
Is it simply that one child can not justify the others ' existence except for a battle to be more loved by their parents or is it something altogether an innate , knee-jerk response to a situation that is inevitably stacking the deck against the other in the give-and-take of familial favoritism jockeying for position of good standing ? ||| 1
Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing , under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple 's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright , but clearly unstable , young son , Joshua ( newcomer Kogan , a real find ) . ||| 1
The couple , Brad and Abby Cairn ( fully fleshed out turns by Rockwell and Farmiga , respectively , both giving career high performances here ) , are resettling their nest with their new bundle of joy and neglecting to notice how their eldest child is apparently not too pleased with his sudden shift to 'second ' favorite child , with all their energies focused on the infant they 've welcomed into the world . ||| 1
Joshua is a smart-beyond his years child but he is taking a dark turn with his studies ( he takes to the Egyptian method of embalming mummies after a class study breaks his void of finding a niche in something to peak his interests ) . ||| 1
He 's also keenly aware of how his mother 's post-partum depression is crippling her sensibilities to the point of mania , manipulating his love for her by picking away at her weak spots ( ie the baby 's constant crying jag that is threatening her sanity ) and he can see he is indeed smarter than his father ( or so it seems ) . ||| 1
While hedge-fund organizer Brad is busy at the office he is not as neglectful as it first appears . ||| 1
He clearly loves his family , has a strong if slightly estranged relationship with his devoutly Christian mother ( Weston ) , and enjoys his high-pressured job even if his jerk boss ( McKean ) can barely tolerate Brad 's paterfamilias peccadilloes . ||| 1
When things begin to get difficult ( Abby is placed into an institution after an accident causes her to become dependent on painkillers and other meds , and a scary hide-and-seek game with Joshua putting her over the edge ) , Brad finally sees the forest for the trees and puts a plan into action to keep his baby safe from harm ; by any means necessary . ||| 1
The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff , in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE , a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight whose screenplay with David Gilbert , another rookie , drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression , family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means . ||| 1
The eerie , piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie 's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface . ||| 1
Rockwell , one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his ( and my ) generation , is excellent . ||| 1
The bantam actor walks with a dancer 's grace , his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world , and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad , who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga 's Abby , who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character ( ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity ) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn . ||| 1
Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step . ||| 1
There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed ' films like THE OMEN ( dapper , sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him ; check ) and ROSEMARY 'S BABY ( spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist 's waif 'do ; check ) but the line stops there , thankfully , not falling into an easy out ( it 's The Devil 's Child ! ) ||| 1
but more like a really decent `` TWILIGHT ZONE '' episode . ||| 1
However the film 's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving , nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare . ||| 1
