Remake of the '80s cheesefest sword & sorcery sci-fi fantasy extravaganza this time with Worthington ( callow and all furrowed brow a la Crowe ; including a buzz-cut ! ) ||| 1
as Perseus the half-human/half-god offspring of mighty Zeus ( Neeson looking like a roadie for AC/DC ) whose sibling rivalry with bro Hades ( Fiennes resembling the contents of your sink 's hair-trap ) whose had it with the mortals and decides they need to pay more heed . ||| 1
Three words : `` Release The Krakken ! '' ||| 1
indeed ! ||| 1
While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants ( and odes to Ray Harryhausen 's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale ) the script by Travis Beacham , Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand . ||| 1
Also : do n't be fooled ; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all ! ||| 1
