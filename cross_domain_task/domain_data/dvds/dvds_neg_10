( Dir : Jeffrey Blitz ) Lame mix of `` ELECTION '' and `` RUSHMORE '' Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass , self-involved , hateful pieces of turgid junk ? ||| 0
I realize they ca n't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred . ||| 0
Hal Hefner ( newcomer Thompson ) is a NJ teen who has a difficult life : namely his father has just left his family to fend for themselves as if he was going onto a better job position instead of total abandonment for no good reason ( well maybe the mother is a bit of a clinger ) , and more notably a persistent , heart-breaking stutter that has made him a complete social misfit at his high school ( and life in general ) . ||| 0
Add to the mix debate team extraordinairre Ginny Ryerson ( newbie Kendrick ) , whose hyperkinetic speech is an obnoxious , grating device that inspires her to force hapless Hal to join the club in spite of his woeful absence of speech in general . ||| 0
Ginny has her reasons : namely she was robbed the previous year of the state championship when her partner Ben Wekselbaum ( D'Agostino ) suddenly froze in the midst of his patter ruining their chances altogether and sending him into self-exiled seclusion . ||| 0
While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering , you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited , ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches ( Hal 's creepy friend 's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes ' `` Blister in The Sun '' ) , the fact NJ ( my home state ) is once again a one-note joke ( and um , shot in BALTIMORE ! ! ! ||| 0
) , and namely no likable characters ( nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run ) . ||| 0
I truly loathed this lame film and hope it does n't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever ' by mixing elements of `` Election '' and `` Rushmore '' ( in fact rent those instead ! ) ||| 0
